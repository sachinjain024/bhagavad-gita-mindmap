        <div class="chapter-meta">Part I: Foundations | 4 Mental Models</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>No Startup Is an Island</h2>
            <p>Every startup exists within an ecosystem—platforms, partners, suppliers, and complementary products. Understanding your position in this ecosystem is crucial for survival and growth. These mental models help you navigate ecosystem dynamics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">15</span>All Startups Belong to an Ecosystem That Makes or Breaks Them</h3>
            <p>You don't operate in isolation. Your success depends on the health and dynamics of your ecosystem. Are you building on iOS or Android? Are you selling to enterprises that use Salesforce or HubSpot? Are you dependent on Google's algorithm or Facebook's ad platform?</p>
            <p>Ecosystem changes can destroy your business overnight. Understand your dependencies, and diversify when possible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pitfall-box">
            <h4>Platform Risk</h4>
            <p>Companies that build entirely on someone else's platform are one policy change away from death. Zynga built on Facebook and nearly died when Facebook changed its algorithm. Build on platforms, but don't be entirely dependent on them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">16</span>Find Partners Who Can Grow Their Business by Building on Top of Yours</h3>
            <p>The best partnerships are those where your partner's success directly requires your success. These create natural alignment.</p>
            <p>If you're a payments company, partner with e-commerce platforms that need payments to make money. If you're an analytics tool, partner with marketing agencies that need analytics to prove their value. When partners need you to succeed, they'll actively promote and protect you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="first-principles">
            <h4>Partnership Alignment Test</h4>
            <p>Ask: "If my partner achieves their goals, do they need more or less of my product?" If the answer is "more," you have alignment. If "less," the partnership has an expiration date.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">17</span>What You Build Your Business On Doesn't Limit How Big It Can Grow</h3>
            <p>Many founders worry about building on "small" platforms or markets. But starting small doesn't mean staying small.</p>
            <p>Shopify started helping small merchants. Slack started as an internal tool. AWS started as infrastructure for Amazon. The platform or market you start with is a launching pad, not a ceiling. Expand methodically once you've proven the model.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="startup-example">
            <h4>Example: Stripe</h4>
            <p>Stripe started by making it easy for developers to accept payments. Developers seemed like a "small" market. But developers build products for everyone—and they brought Stripe into every company they joined. Starting small with the right audience led to massive scale.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">18</span>Commoditize Your Value Chain Before It Commoditizes You</h3>
            <p>In every value chain, some parts are commodities and some capture value. The layers that are commodities subsidize the layers that capture value.</p>
            <p>Google commoditizes operating systems (Android is free) to capture value in search and ads. Amazon commoditizes shipping to capture value in retail. Netflix commoditizes content distribution to capture value in subscription.</p>
            <p><strong>Strategic insight:</strong> Commoditize layers adjacent to you so you capture more value. If you don't, someone else will commoditize your layer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="framework-box">
            <h4>Value Chain Strategy</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Map your value chain</strong>: What layers exist between your product and the end customer?</li>
                <li><strong>Identify where value is captured</strong>: Which layers have pricing power?</li>
                <li><strong>Commoditize adjacent layers</strong>: Make the layers next to you free or cheap</li>
                <li><strong>Protect your layer</strong>: Build moats so your layer can't be commoditized</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
