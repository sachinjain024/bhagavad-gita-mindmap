        <div class="chapter-meta">Part VI: Mindset | 6 Mental Models</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Thinking Clearly in a Noisy World</h2>
            <p>Our brains are pattern-matching machines that evolved for survival, not truth-seeking. They're full of biases that lead to systematic errors. Entrepreneurs are especially susceptible because they need conviction—but conviction can blind you. These mental models help you think more clearly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">56</span>Map Is Not the Territory</h3>
            <p>Your mental model of reality is not reality. Your financial projections are not the future. Your customer persona is not your actual customers. Every model is a simplification—useful but incomplete.</p>
            <p>The danger is forgetting that models are models. When your model says X and reality says Y, update the model. Never force reality to fit your model.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="first-principles">
            <h4>Model Humility</h4>
            <p>Ask yourself regularly: "What am I assuming that might not be true?" Your business plan is a hypothesis. Your strategy is a guess. The best entrepreneurs hold strong opinions loosely—ready to update when evidence demands it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">57</span>Always Seek Disconfirmatory Evidence</h3>
            <p>Confirmation bias makes us seek evidence that supports what we already believe. We read the reviews that praise our product and dismiss the ones that criticize. We remember the successes and forget the failures.</p>
            <p>Fight this actively. Seek out critics, not cheerleaders. Ask "What would prove me wrong?" and go looking for that evidence. The truth is rarely comfortable, but it's always useful.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pitfall-box">
            <h4>The Confirmation Trap</h4>
            <p>Founders are especially vulnerable because they've invested their identity in their vision. Admitting the vision is wrong feels like personal failure. But the cost of ignoring reality is much higher than the discomfort of updating your beliefs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">58</span>Never Ask Your Friends or Family If They Like Your Idea</h3>
            <p>Friends and family will tell you what you want to hear. They love you and don't want to hurt you. This makes them useless for honest feedback about your business idea.</p>
            <p>Get feedback from strangers with no emotional investment in your success. Better yet, get feedback from potential customers who can demonstrate interest with their behavior, not just their words.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">59</span>Ask People What They Did, Not What They Will Do</h3>
            <p>If you ask "Would you use this product?" people will give you aspirational answers. Yes, they'd love to exercise more. Yes, they'd pay for that. Yes, they'd definitely download your app.</p>
            <p>These predictions are unreliable. Instead, ask about past behavior: "How did you solve this problem last week?" "When was the last time you tried something similar?" "How much did you pay?" Past behavior predicts future behavior; intentions don't.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="action-insight">
            <h4>Better Customer Questions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Instead of:</strong> "Would you use this?" → <strong>Ask:</strong> "How do you handle this now?"</li>
                <li><strong>Instead of:</strong> "Would you pay $X?" → <strong>Ask:</strong> "What did you pay for the last solution?"</li>
                <li><strong>Instead of:</strong> "Is this useful?" → <strong>Ask:</strong> "Tell me about the last time you had this problem."</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">60</span>Stop Assuming That Your Customers Want Things That You Want</h3>
            <p>You are not your customer—unless you've carefully verified that you are. What excites you might bore them. What frustrates you might not bother them. What seems obvious to you might be confusing to them.</p>
            <p>The best founders build products they'd want themselves. But even they verify constantly. Customer empathy requires effort—talking, observing, testing. Never assume; always verify.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">61</span>Think from First Principles Before You Google (or Ask ChatGPT)</h3>
            <p>The internet gives instant access to other people's answers. This is useful but dangerous. You skip the thinking that builds real understanding.</p>
            <p>Before searching for how others solved a problem, try to reason through it yourself. What are the core constraints? What are possible solutions? Why might those work or fail? Then search to refine your thinking—not replace it.</p>
        </div>

            "The goal isn't to have the right answers. It's to develop the ability to think clearly enough that you can find the right answers when you need them."

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Models ≠ Reality:</strong> Your mental models are simplifications; update them constantly</li>
