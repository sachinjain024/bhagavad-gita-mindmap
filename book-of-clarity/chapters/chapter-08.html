        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Art of Compelling Communication</h2>
            <p>Whether you're pitching investors, recruiting talent, or getting press coverage, you need to make people care about what you're building. These mental models help you communicate in ways that resonate.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">37</span>Your 30 Second Pitch Shouldn't Be About You</h3>
            <p>Most founders describe their company: "We're an AI-powered platform that uses machine learning to optimize..." Nobody cares. Everyone's pitching something.</p>
            <p>Your pitch should be about <em>them</em>—the listener, their problems, their aspirations. "You know how [problem they have]? We solve that by [simple solution]." Make it about their world, not your technology.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="action-insight">
            <h4>The "You-Focused" Pitch</h4>
            <p><strong>Bad:</strong> "We built an AI scheduling tool with natural language processing."</p>
            <p><strong>Good:</strong> "You know how scheduling meetings takes 17 back-and-forth emails? We made it one click."</p>
            <p>Lead with the problem they feel, not the solution you built.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">38</span>Get Press by Giving Journalists Something Surprising</h3>
            <p>Journalists don't cover companies—they cover stories. And stories need surprise. "New startup launches" isn't a story. "Founder drops out of Harvard to build a rocket company in his garage" is a story.</p>
            <p>What's genuinely surprising about your company? The founder's background? The contrarian approach? The unexpected result? The audacious goal? Find your surprising angle and lead with it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="paras-quote">
            "Journalists are looking for stories their readers will share. Ask yourself: 'Would someone forward this article to a friend?' If not, it's not newsworthy."
            <cite>— Paras Chopra</cite>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">39</span>Raise Funding by Showing How You Can Raise Even More Funding</h3>
            <p>Investors aren't just evaluating your company—they're evaluating whether they can make money. The best way to show this is to demonstrate that other investors will want in, driving your valuation up.</p>
            <p>Focus on FOMO (fear of missing out). Show that you're a hot deal, that you have multiple interested investors, that this round is moving fast. Investors want to invest in companies that other investors want.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="investor-insight">
            <h4>The VC Logic</h4>
            <p>VCs make money when companies get bigger valuations in later rounds. To raise your A round at a higher valuation, you need B round investors to be interested. Show that trajectory—growing traction, increasing interest, escalating momentum.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">40</span>Recruit Exceptional People by Showing Them a Promised Land</h3>
            <p>Exceptional people have options. They can work anywhere. You can't compete with Big Tech on salary. You compete on <em>vision</em>.</p>
            <p>Show exceptional candidates a future they want to be part of. A mission that matters. A team they'll learn from. A role where they'll have impact. Paint a picture of what the world will look like when you succeed, and invite them to help build it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="startup-example">
            <h4>Vision-Selling in Recruitment</h4>
            <p>SpaceX recruits with "make humanity multiplanetary." Tesla recruits with "accelerate the transition to sustainable energy." Stripe recruits with "increase the GDP of the internet."</p>
            <p>The mission attracts missionaries. Mercenaries go to the highest bidder.</p>
