        <div class="chapter-meta">Part IV: Growth | 5 Mental Models</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Understanding the Investor Mindset</h2>
            <p>To raise money effectively—or to decide whether you even should—you need to understand how investors think. Their incentives and valuation methods shape the entire startup ecosystem. These mental models demystify investor logic.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">41</span>Your Business Is Worth All Future Profits It Is Expected to Generate</h3>
            <p>In theory, a company's value is the sum of all future profits, discounted to present value. In practice, this means investors are betting on your growth trajectory more than your current state.</p>
            <p>A company making $1M today with 100% year-over-year growth is worth more than a company making $5M today with 10% growth. The first one might be worth $100M+; the second might be worth $10M. Growth rate is everything.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="first-principles">
            <h4>The Growth Premium</h4>
            <p>Investors pay for growth because high-growth companies capture larger future markets. A 10x revenue multiple on a stagnant company is generous. A 50x multiple on a high-growth company can be rational. The difference is expected future profits.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">42</span>Business Quality Is Determined by One Metric: Return on Invested Capital</h3>
            <p>The best businesses generate high returns on every dollar invested. If you invest $1 and get $2 back, you can keep investing and compounding. If you invest $1 and get $0.50 back, you're slowly dying.</p>
            <p><strong>Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)</strong> is the ultimate measure of business quality. High ROIC means you can grow without constantly raising more money. Low ROIC means you're dependent on investors forever.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">43</span>Investors Will Prioritize Financial Returns Over Your Ambitions</h3>
            <p>This isn't cynicism—it's their job. Investors have a fiduciary duty to their LPs (the people whose money they invest). When push comes to shove, they'll prioritize returns over your vision, your team, or your values.</p>
            <p>Understand this clearly before taking investment. Investors are partners, but their interests and yours aren't always aligned. Know when they diverge.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pitfall-box">
            <h4>Misaligned Incentives</h4>
            <p>VCs need big exits to return their fund. They might push you to take risks you wouldn't otherwise take—"go big or go home." Your preference for a sustainable, profitable business might conflict with their need for a 10x return.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">44</span>Great Entrepreneurs Think Like Investors</h3>
            <p>The best founders understand how investors think—even if they never raise money. They evaluate opportunities based on expected returns, consider opportunity costs, and think in terms of capital allocation.</p>
            <p>Every decision is an investment: hiring someone, building a feature, entering a market. Thinking like an investor means asking: "What's the expected return on this investment compared to alternatives?"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="action-insight">
            <h4>Investment Thinking in Practice</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Before building a feature: "What's the expected revenue per engineering hour?"</li>
                <li>Before hiring: "What's the ROI of this role compared to alternatives?"</li>
                <li>Before marketing spend: "What's the customer acquisition cost vs. lifetime value?"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">45</span>Profit Overpowers Ethics, If Left Unchecked</h3>
            <p>Markets reward profit, not virtue. Without intentional effort, the pressure for returns can push companies toward unethical behavior. This happens gradually—small compromises that compound.</p>
            <p>Great founders build ethical guardrails into their companies from day one. They're explicit about values, they create accountability mechanisms, and they're willing to sacrifice short-term profits for long-term integrity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="paras-quote">
            "The question isn't whether you'll face ethical dilemmas—you will. The question is whether you've built a company that can resist the pressure when it comes."
            <cite>— Paras Chopra</cite>
