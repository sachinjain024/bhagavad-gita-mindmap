        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 11: Incentives, Culture & Organization</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part V: Organization | 7 Mental Models</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Building a Company That Scales</h2>
            <p>As you grow, your organization becomes more important than your product. Culture, incentives, and structure determine whether you scale effectively or collapse under your own weight. These mental models help you build an organization that works.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">49</span>Your Team's Culture Is Defined by Your Behavior, Not Your Words</h3>
            <p>Every company has values on their website. Almost none of them mean anything. Culture isn't what you say—it's what you do. What gets rewarded? What gets punished? What do leaders do when no one's watching?</p>
            <p>If you say "we value work-life balance" but send emails at midnight, you've defined a culture of overwork. If you say "we value honesty" but punish bad news, you've created a culture of hiding problems. Actions define culture; words are noise.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="paras-quote">
            "Culture is what happens when leadership isn't in the room. It's the thousand small decisions that people make based on what they think the company actually values—not what it claims to value."
            <cite>— Paras Chopra</cite>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">50</span>Don't Hire for Roles, Hire for a Change</h3>
            <p>Job descriptions focus on tasks. But great hires are about change—what will be different because this person joined? A "marketing manager" is a role; "double our pipeline in 6 months" is a change.</p>
            <p>When hiring, define the change you need. Then find someone who has made that change before. Hire for transformation, not maintenance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="action-insight">
            <h4>The Change-Based Job Description</h4>
            <p>Instead of listing responsibilities, define:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What does success look like in 6 months?</li>
                <li>What will be different about the company because of this hire?</li>
                <li>What capability gap does this person fill?</li>
                <li>What have they done before that suggests they can do this?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">51</span>People Don't Leave Companies, They Leave Their Bosses</h3>
            <p>Most turnover isn't about compensation, culture, or career growth—it's about the direct manager. Great managers retain great people. Bad managers drive them away.</p>
            <p>Invest in management development. Promote people who build great teams, not just great individual contributors. Fire managers who consistently lose good people.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">52</span>The Number One Job of a Founder Is to Communicate Clarity</h3>
            <p>At a startup, everyone is making decisions with incomplete information. The founder's job is to provide clarity—a clear vision of where you're going, why it matters, and what it means for each person's work.</p>
            <p>Repeat yourself constantly. What seems obvious to you after thinking about it for months is new to someone who just joined. Communicate the same message in every meeting, email, and all-hands until it becomes instinctive.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="first-principles">
            <h4>The Clarity Test</h4>
            <p>Ask any team member: "What is the company's top priority right now? What should you be working on? Why does it matter?" If they can't answer clearly and consistently, you haven't communicated enough.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">53</span>Aim to Be a Cult by Hiring People Who Obsess About the Same Things</h3>
            <p>The best early-stage teams feel slightly cult-like. Everyone believes deeply in the mission. They share references, values, and obsessions. They're not just colleagues—they're co-believers.</p>
            <p>This isn't toxic—it's necessary for survival. Startups require unreasonable effort. That effort only comes from unreasonable belief. Hire people who genuinely care about what you're building, not mercenaries who are just passing through.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">54</span>Your Company's Org Chart Is More Important Than You Think</h3>
            <p>Who reports to whom determines what gets done. Structure creates incentives, silos, and information flows. A bad org chart creates constant friction; a good one creates natural alignment.</p>
            <p>Think carefully about structure. Put functions that need to collaborate close together. Create clear ownership boundaries. Reorganize when you notice recurring conflicts or bottlenecks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pitfall-box">
            <h4>The Org Chart Trap</h4>
            <p>Many founders ignore org structure until it's a crisis. By then, political fiefdoms have formed and reorganization is painful. Design your structure intentionally from the start and evolve it as you grow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">55</span>You're Probably Not a Good Leader (Because Being That Is So Hard)</h3>
            <p>Great leadership is exceptionally rare. It requires self-awareness, emotional intelligence, strategic thinking, communication skills, and the ability to make hard decisions under uncertainty. Most people—including most founders—aren't naturally good at all of these.</p>
            <p>The good news: leadership can be developed. But first, you must admit you're not great at it yet. Seek feedback relentlessly. Work with coaches. Study great leaders. Leadership is a skill to be learned, not a trait to be born with.</p>
        </div>
