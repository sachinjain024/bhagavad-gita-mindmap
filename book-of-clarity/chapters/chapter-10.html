        <div class="section">
            <h2>Navigating the Path Forward</h2>
            <p>How do you know if you're on the right track? How do you set direction when the future is uncertain? These mental models help you read signals and steer your company through ambiguity.</p>

            <h3><span class="model-number">46</span>What Kills Startups Is the Lack of Feedback</h3>
            <p>Startups don't usually die from one catastrophic mistake. They die slowly from lack of feedback—building in isolation, ignoring signals, or waiting too long to test assumptions.</p>
            <p>The faster you get feedback, the faster you can correct course. Ship early, talk to customers constantly, watch metrics obsessively. Silence is the enemy—it lets you drift off course without knowing it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="first-principles">
            <h4>Feedback Loops</h4>
            <p>Build your company around fast feedback loops:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Daily:</strong> Are users engaging? What are support tickets saying?</li>
                <li><strong>Weekly:</strong> Are key metrics moving? What did we learn from releases?</li>
                <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> Are we hitting targets? What should we change?</li>
                <li><strong>Quarterly:</strong> Is our strategy working? Should we pivot?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">47</span>Study Your Most Successful Customers to Set Your Direction</h3>
            <p>Your best customers are trying to tell you where to go. They're not just users—they're signals about where your product provides the most value.</p>
            <p>Who are your power users? What do they have in common? What problem are they solving? What industry are they in? What do they wish you'd build? Your most successful customers are a roadmap to product-market fit.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="startup-example">
            <h4>Example: Slack</h4>
            <p>Slack noticed that gaming companies were their most engaged users. They studied why: fast-paced communication, distributed teams, always-on culture. This helped them understand their value proposition and target similar characteristics in other industries.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mental-model">
            <h3><span class="model-number">48</span>Your North Star Metric Should Be a Leading Indicator of Profits</h3>
            <p>Choosing the right metric to optimize is one of the most important strategic decisions. The wrong metric leads you astray. The right metric aligns the whole company toward value creation.</p>
            <p>Your North Star should be a <strong>leading indicator</strong> of profits—something that, if it improves, profits will follow. For Airbnb, it's nights booked. For Facebook, it's daily active users. For Slack, it's messages sent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pitfall-box">
            <h4>Vanity Metrics</h4>
            <p>Beware of metrics that look good but don't lead to profits. Total signups (without activation), page views (without engagement), and app downloads (without retention) are vanity metrics. They feel good but don't predict success.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="action-insight">
            <h4>Finding Your North Star</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify what action correlates most with customer retention and expansion</li>
                <li>Verify that improving this metric leads to revenue growth</li>
                <li>Ensure every team can influence this metric through their work</li>
                <li>Make it simple enough that everyone in the company understands it</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

            <h3>Key Takeaways from Chapter 10</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Feedback Saves:</strong> Fast feedback loops prevent slow death from isolation</li>
                <li><strong>Follow Success:</strong> Your best customers show you where to go</li>
                <li><strong>Right Metrics:</strong> Choose leading indicators that predict profits</li>
            </ul>
