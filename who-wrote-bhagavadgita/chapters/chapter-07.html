        <div class="chapter-meta">Part III: The Three Authors | The First Layer (~600 BCE)</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Earliest Author</h2>
            <p>The first author of the Gita wrote approximately 126 verses around 600 BCE, in the late Upanishadic period before Buddhism's rise. This author addressed an educated audience of seekers wrestling with fundamental questions: How can we act in the world without being bound by karma? What is the relationship between action and liberation?</p>

            <h4>Profile of Author One</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Verse Contribution:</strong> 126 verses (~18% of the Gita)</li>
                <li><strong>Primary Focus:</strong> Karma yoga, sannyasa, renunciation</li>
                <li><strong>Audience:</strong> Educated seekers, philosophical elite</li>
                <li><strong>Historical Context:</strong> Late Upanishadic period</li>
                <li><strong>Central Problem:</strong> Reconciling action with liberation</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Philosophical Context</h2>
            <p>The late Upanishadic period presented a crisis for thoughtful Hindus. The Upanishads taught that ultimate reality (Brahman) was unchanging and that the goal of life was moksha, liberation from the cycle of rebirth. But how could one achieve this while living in the world, performing actions, accumulating karma?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>The Central Dilemma</h3>
            <p>The Upanishads seemed to suggest that liberation required complete renunciation of action (sannyasa). But this was impractical for most people, especially the warrior class (kshatriyas) whose duty (dharma) required action in the world. How could a warrior achieve liberation while fulfilling his social obligations?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Author One's Solution: Karma Yoga</h2>
            <p>Author One's answer was revolutionary: it's not action itself that binds us, but attachment to the fruits of action. One can act in the world, even violently, without accumulating karma if one acts without desire for results.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse-reference">
            <span class="verse-id">Key Teaching: Nishkama Karma</span>
            <p><em>"You have the right to action alone, never to its fruits. Do not let the fruits of action be your motive, nor let yourself be attached to inaction."</em> (2.47)</p>
            <p>This verse, attributed to Author One, encapsulates karma yoga: act from duty, not desire; perform your dharma without attachment to outcomes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Characteristics of Author One's Verses</h2>
            <p>Desai identifies several features that distinguish Author One's contributions:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="scholarly-insight">
            <h4>Stylistic Markers</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Philosophical Density:</strong> Complex arguments requiring sustained attention</li>
                <li><strong>Upanishadic Vocabulary:</strong> Heavy use of Brahman, atman, moksha</li>
                <li><strong>Abstract Reasoning:</strong> Minimal narrative, maximum philosophy</li>
                <li><strong>Elite Audience:</strong> Assumes prior philosophical knowledge</li>
                <li><strong>Sankhya Influence:</strong> Uses Sankhya categories of consciousness and matter</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Sankhya-Yoga Framework</h2>
            <p>Author One draws heavily on Sankhya philosophy, which distinguishes between:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse-comparison">
            <div class="author-column">
                <h4>Purusha</h4>
                <p>Pure consciousness, the true Self, eternal and unchanging</p>
            </div>
            <div class="author-column">
                <h4>Prakriti</h4>
                <p>Material nature, constantly changing, the source of action and its effects</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <p>In this framework, all action belongs to Prakriti (nature), not Purusha (the Self). The Self is always free; only our identification with the body-mind creates the illusion of bondage. By recognizing this distinction, one can act in the world while remaining inwardly free.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="historical-context">
            <h4>Why This Mattered</h4>
            <p>This teaching served an important social function: it allowed the warrior class to fulfill their violent duties without feeling spiritually compromised. A kshatriya could fight and kill, as long as he did so from duty rather than anger, without attachment to victory or defeat.</p>
            <p>Critics like Ambedkar would later argue this was a convenient philosophy for maintaining social hierarchy: each caste could be told to perform its prescribed duties without questioning the system.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Pre-Buddhist Character</h2>
            <p>Author One's verses show no awareness of Buddhist challenge to Brahmanical religion. There is no mention of Buddhist concepts like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nirvana (which appears in later sections)</li>
                <li>Compassion for all beings as a central virtue</li>
                <li>Rejection of Vedic authority</li>
                <li>The Middle Way between asceticism and indulgence</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This absence suggests these verses were composed before Buddhism became a significant force, supporting the ~600 BCE dating.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>The Original Gita?</h3>
            <p>Author One's verses may represent something like the "original Gita," a philosophical discourse on karma and action later expanded by subsequent authors. This original core addressed a specific problem (action vs. liberation) for a specific audience (the kshatriya elite) at a specific time (late Upanishadic period).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="desai-quote">
            "Author One wrote for seekers who had heard the Upanishads and were troubled by their implications. How can I be a warrior if action binds? The answer, karma yoga, was both philosophically sophisticated and socially convenient."
            <cite>Meghnad Desai</cite>
