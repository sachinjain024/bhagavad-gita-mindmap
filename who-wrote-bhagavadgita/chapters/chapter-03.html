        <div class="chapter-meta">Part I: Context & Significance | The Evolution of the Epic</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>An Epic That Grew Over Centuries</h2>
            <p>To understand the Gita's authorship, we must first understand the text in which it is embedded. The Mahabharata didn't emerge fully formed; it evolved over centuries from a smaller work into the world's longest epic. This evolutionary history is crucial to Desai's argument about the Gita's composite authorship.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>The Traditional Account</h3>
            <p>According to tradition, the sage Vyasa composed the entire Mahabharata, dictating it to Ganesha, who wrote it down. This would make Vyasa the author of the Gita as well, since Krishna's dialogue with Arjuna is part of the larger epic.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Textual Evidence</h2>
            <p>Scholarly analysis reveals a different story. The Mahabharata itself contains references to its own evolution:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline">
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Stage 1: Jaya (~8,800 verses)</h4>
                <p>The original core, called "Jaya" (Victory), was a relatively brief narrative about the war between the Pandavas and Kauravas. This may date to the late Vedic period.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Stage 2: Bharata (~24,000 verses)</h4>
                <p>The text expanded to include more stories, genealogies, and philosophical material. This version, called "Bharata," was approximately three times the length of the original.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Stage 3: Mahabharata (~100,000 verses)</h4>
                <p>The final recension, our "Mahabharata," grew to include vast amounts of didactic material, including the Bhagavad Gita. This evolution took place over several centuries, perhaps from 400 BCE to 400 CE.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="scholarly-insight">
            <h4>Evidence for Growth</h4>
            <p>The Mahabharata itself acknowledges this growth in a famous verse: "What is found here may be found elsewhere; what is not found here exists nowhere." This encyclopedia claim reflects the text's status as a repository of accumulated wisdom rather than a single author's composition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>When Was the Gita Inserted?</h2>
            <p>The Bhagavad Gita appears in Book 6 (Bhishma Parva) of the Mahabharata. But was it originally part of the Jaya, the Bharata, or added during the final Mahabharata stage?</p>
            <p>Several factors suggest it was a later addition:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse-reference">
            <span class="verse-id">Evidence for Later Insertion</span>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Narrative Interruption:</strong> The Gita's 700 verses halt the battle narrative at a dramatically inopportune moment</li>
                <li><strong>Philosophical Sophistication:</strong> Its developed philosophy suggests a later date than the core war story</li>
                <li><strong>Buddhist Concepts:</strong> Terms like "nirvana" and developed karma theory suggest a post-Buddhist context</li>
                <li><strong>Bhakti Elements:</strong> The devotional aspects point to the bhakti movement's influence</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Problem of "Vyasa"</h2>
            <p>The name "Vyasa" literally means "compiler" or "arranger." This may not be a personal name but a title for whoever compiled the text at various stages. There may have been multiple "Vyasas" over the centuries, each adding to the growing corpus.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="historical-context">
            <h4>Multiple Compilers</h4>
            <p>Ancient Indian textual tradition acknowledged collective authorship. The Vedas were "heard" by different sages. The Upanishads have varied attributed authors. The idea that a single "Vyasa" wrote the entire Mahabharata including the Gita may be a later simplification of a more complex process of composition and compilation.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Dating the Gita</h2>
            <p>Scholars have attempted to date the Gita using various methods:</p>

        <div class="verse-comparison">
            <div class="author-column">
                <h4>External Evidence</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>No mention before 3rd century BCE</li>
                    <li>Reflects developed yoga and sankhya systems</li>
                    <li>Uses Buddhist terminology</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="author-column">
                <h4>Internal Evidence</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Multiple philosophical layers</li>
                    <li>Inconsistent vocabulary across chapters</li>
                    <li>Different theological emphases</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <p>Most scholars date the Gita between 500 BCE and 200 CE, with different portions likely composed at different times within this range. This is precisely what the three-author theory suggests.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="desai-quote">
            "The Mahabharata is not a book; it is a library. The Gita is not a chapter; it is an inserted treatise. Understanding this changes everything about how we read it."
            <cite>Meghnad Desai</cite>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Implications for the Gita</h2>
            <p>If the Mahabharata itself is a composite text that grew over centuries, then any part of it, including the Gita, may also be composite. The tradition of growth and insertion that characterizes the larger epic may apply to the Gita itself.</p>
            <p>This sets the stage for Desai's central argument: just as the Mahabharata grew from Jaya to its final form, the Gita itself may have grown from an original core to its current 700 verses, with different authors contributing at different stages.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="critical-box">
            <h4>The Methodological Point</h4>
            <p>If we accept that the Mahabharata is a composite text (which most scholars do), we cannot automatically assume that any individual part, including the Gita, is a unified composition. The same processes that created the larger text may have operated on its components.</p>

            <h3>Key Insights from Chapter 3</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Textual Evolution:</strong> The Mahabharata grew from ~8,800 verses (Jaya) to ~100,000 verses over centuries</li>
                <li><strong>Later Insertion:</strong> Evidence suggests the Gita was added to the epic at a relatively late stage</li>
                <li><strong>"Vyasa" as Title:</strong> The name may indicate a role (compiler) rather than a single author</li>
                <li><strong>Dating Range:</strong> Scholarly consensus places the Gita between 500 BCE and 200 CE</li>
                <li><strong>Composite Implication:</strong> If the larger epic is composite, its parts may be composite too</li>
