            <h2>Writing in the Shadow of the Buddha</h2>
            <p>The second author wrote approximately 119 verses during the 5th century BCE, a period when Buddhism was emerging as a powerful challenge to Brahmanical religion. This author engaged with Buddhist ideas, sometimes absorbing them, sometimes countering them, always seeking to maintain the relevance of Vedic tradition in a changing religious landscape.</p>

            <h4>Profile of Author Two</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Verse Contribution:</strong> 119 verses (~17% of the Gita)</li>
                <li><strong>Primary Focus:</strong> Karma theory, sattvika qualities, ethical conduct</li>
                <li><strong>Audience:</strong> Philosophical elite engaging with Buddhist ideas</li>
                <li><strong>Historical Context:</strong> Rise of Buddhism as a rival tradition</li>
                <li><strong>Central Problem:</strong> Responding to Buddhist challenge while preserving Brahmanical authority</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Buddhist Challenge</h2>
            <p>The Buddha (c. 563-483 BCE) presented a radical critique of Brahmanical religion:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="response-box">
            <h4>Buddhism's Critique</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rejected Vedic Authority:</strong> The Buddha denied that the Vedas were revealed truth</li>
                <li><strong>Rejected Caste:</strong> Spiritual attainment was open to all, not hereditary</li>
                <li><strong>Rejected Ritual:</strong> Elaborate sacrifices were useless for liberation</li>
                <li><strong>Rejected Atman:</strong> There is no eternal self; belief in self causes suffering</li>
                <li><strong>Offered Nirvana:</strong> A state of liberation accessible through ethical conduct and meditation</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <p>This was an existential threat to the Brahmanical establishment. Buddhism attracted followers across all castes, including wealthy merchants and even kings. The old order had to respond or become irrelevant.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>The Strategy of Incorporation</h3>
            <p>Author Two's strategy was subtle: rather than directly attacking Buddhism, incorporate its attractive elements while maintaining essential Brahmanical doctrines. Borrow Buddhist ethical emphasis; keep the atman. Use Buddhist terminology; preserve Vedic authority.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Buddhist Terms in Author Two's Verses</h2>
            <p>Desai notes several Buddhist concepts that appear in Author Two's sections:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse-reference">
            <span class="verse-id">Borrowed Terminology</span>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nirvana:</strong> The term appears in the Gita, though redefined to mean union with Brahman rather than extinction</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Emphasis:</strong> Greater focus on moral conduct than in Author One's sections</li>
                <li><strong>Sattvika Qualities:</strong> Purity, truthfulness, self-control, emphasized as Buddhist ethics were</li>
                <li><strong>Karma Refinement:</strong> More developed theory of karma and rebirth, influenced by Buddhist articulation</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Three Gunas</h2>
            <p>Author Two elaborates the theory of the three gunas (qualities) that comprise all of manifest reality:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse-comparison">
            <div class="author-column">
                <h4>Sattva</h4>
                <p>Purity, light, knowledge, goodness. The quality to cultivate.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="author-column">
                <h4>Rajas</h4>
                <p>Passion, activity, desire. Creates attachment and suffering.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="author-column">
                <h4>Tamas</h4>
                <p>Darkness, inertia, ignorance. The lowest quality, to be overcome.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <p>This framework allowed Author Two to provide ethical guidance without abandoning Brahmanical metaphysics. One should cultivate sattvika qualities (truthfulness, non-violence, self-discipline) while recognizing that ultimate liberation transcends all three gunas.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="scholarly-insight">
            <h4>Competing with Buddhist Ethics</h4>
            <p>Buddhism had attracted followers partly through its clear ethical teachings: the Five Precepts, the Eightfold Path, the emphasis on compassion. Author Two responded by articulating equally compelling ethical principles within a Brahmanical framework.</p>
            <p>The message: you don't need to become Buddhist to be ethical. Hinduism offers the same moral guidance while preserving your connection to Vedic tradition.</p>

            <h2>Characteristics of Author Two's Verses</h2>
            <p>Desai identifies distinctive features of this author's contributions:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="author-box">
            <h4>Stylistic Markers</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ethical Focus:</strong> More concern with right conduct than pure metaphysics</li>
                <li><strong>Guna Theory:</strong> Extensive use of sattva-rajas-tamas framework</li>
                <li><strong>Buddhist Vocabulary:</strong> Terms like nirvana, used in non-Buddhist sense</li>
                <li><strong>Systematic Classification:</strong> Tendency to categorize (three types of food, faith, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Practical Guidance:</strong> More emphasis on how to live than on abstract philosophy</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="historical-context">
            <h4>The Battle for Hearts and Minds</h4>
            <p>Author Two was not merely philosophizing but competing. The 5th century BCE saw a religious marketplace where different traditions vied for followers. Buddhism offered a compelling package: ethical clarity, meditation practice, egalitarian community. Brahmanism had to match these offerings while maintaining its distinctive features.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="desai-quote">
            "Author Two faced a challenge that Author One never knew: the Buddha's revolution. His verses are not purely philosophical but polemical, an attempt to keep thoughtful Hindus from defecting to the new religion."
            <cite>Meghnad Desai</cite>
