        <div class="chapter-meta">Part IV: Context & Critique | Contemporary Relevance and Problems</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>From History to Present</h2>
            <p>In his most controversial chapter, Desai moves from historical analysis to contemporary critique. Having argued that the Gita was written by humans in specific historical contexts, he asks: what happens when a historically conditioned text is treated as timeless wisdom? Some aspects of the Gita, he argues, may be unsuitable for modern India.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="critical-box">
            <h4>A Controversial Position</h4>
            <p>This chapter provoked the strongest reactions to Desai's book. Some critics found his critique of a revered scripture offensive; others appreciated his willingness to apply critical thinking to sacred texts. Desai himself acknowledges this is the most subjective part of his analysis.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Problem of Svadharma</h2>
            <p>Desai's primary concern is the Gita's teaching of svadharma, "one's own duty" determined by birth. Krishna tells Arjuna that it is better to perform one's own dharma imperfectly than another's dharma perfectly. While this teaching has a philosophical dimension (be authentic to yourself), it also has a social dimension: stay in your caste role.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse-reference">
            <span class="verse-id">The Problematic Verse</span>
            <p><em>"Better is one's own dharma, though imperfectly performed, than the dharma of another well performed. Better is death in one's own dharma; the dharma of another is fraught with peril."</em> (3.35)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <p>This teaching, Desai argues, has been used to justify caste hierarchy: Brahmins should do Brahmin work, Shudras should do Shudra work, and no one should aspire beyond their birth station. The promise of liberation through devotion doesn't change one's present caste duties.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Ambedkar's Critique Revisited</h3>
            <p>Desai echoes B.R. Ambedkar's earlier criticism: the Gita provides philosophical justification for the caste system. Its teaching of detached action allows upper castes to perform oppressive duties without guilt (they're just following their dharma), while its promise of future liberation encourages lower castes to accept present suffering.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Violence Question</h2>
            <p>The Gita's setting is a battlefield, and Krishna ultimately convinces Arjuna to fight and kill. Desai asks: what are the implications of a sacred text that sanctions violence?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="scholarly-insight">
            <h4>The Tilak-Gandhi Divergence</h4>
            <p>Tilak read the Gita as justifying revolutionary violence; Gandhi read it as teaching non-violence. Both readings are possible because the text is ambiguous. But its literal setting endorses killing when dharma demands it. This has been used to justify violence throughout Indian history.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Indifference to Suffering</h2>
            <p>The Gita's teaching of detachment, while philosophically sophisticated, can lead to indifference toward suffering:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the atman is eternal, physical suffering is ultimately unreal</li>
                <li>If karma determines present conditions, inequality is deserved</li>
                <li>If liberation transcends the world, worldly reform is less important</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These implications, Desai suggests, may have contributed to India's historical tolerance of extreme poverty and caste oppression.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="response-box">
            <h4>The Defense</h4>
            <p>Defenders of the Gita argue:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The text must be read in historical context, not as a blueprint for modern society</li>
                <li>Its teachings of karma yoga and nishkama karma can inspire social service</li>
                <li>Gandhi extracted a message of non-violence and equality</li>
                <li>No text should be judged solely by its worst interpretations</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What Modern India Needs</h2>
            <p>Desai contrasts the Gita's teachings with the values modern India claims to uphold:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse-comparison">
            <div class="author-column">
                <h4>Gita's Framework</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Svadharma: Stay in your birth role</li>
                    <li>Detachment: Don't be attached to outcomes</li>
                    <li>Karma: Accept current conditions as deserved</li>
                    <li>Liberation: Transcend rather than transform the world</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="author-column">
                <h4>Constitutional Values</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Equality: All citizens equal before law</li>
                    <li>Mobility: Right to pursue any profession</li>
                    <li>Justice: Society should be reformed</li>
                    <li>Development: Material progress matters</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>A Call for Critical Reading</h2>
            <p>Desai does not argue that the Gita should be rejected or forgotten. He argues that it should be read critically, as a historical document reflecting its times, not as a timeless guide for modern life. Its genuine insights (detachment from ego, importance of duty, paths to transcendence) can be appreciated while acknowledging its problematic elements.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>The Secular Approach</h3>
            <p>A secular reading of the Gita, Desai suggests, would:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Appreciate its historical and literary significance</li>
                <li>Learn from its philosophical insights selectively</li>
                <li>Reject its social implications where they conflict with modern values</li>
                <li>Treat it as human wisdom, not divine revelation</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Reactions and Controversies</h2>
            <p>This chapter generated significant controversy. Critics argued that Desai was:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Imposing Western values on an Indian text</li>
                <li>Reading the Gita too literally</li>
                <li>Ignoring its liberating interpretations</li>
                <li>Disrespecting a sacred scripture</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Supporters appreciated his willingness to apply critical analysis to revered texts, noting that similar critique is applied to religious texts in other traditions.</p>

        <div class="desai-quote">
            "The Gita is not toxic because it is the Gita, but because some of its teachings, taken literally and applied universally, produce toxic results. Critical reading is not rejection; it is mature engagement."
