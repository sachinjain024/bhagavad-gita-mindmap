        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Hidden Hand</h2>
            <p>If three different authors wrote the Gita across several centuries, who combined their works into a single text? Desai proposes that Badarayana, the author of the Brahmasutra, served as the final editor who wove together disparate strands into the unified 700-verse text we know today.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="author-box">
            <span class="period">~200 BCE - 200 CE | Compilation Period</span>
            <h4>Badarayana's Role</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Function:</strong> Editor/compiler rather than original author</li>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> Unifying three separate texts into coherent whole</li>
                <li><strong>Method:</strong> Adding transitional material, ordering chapters, smoothing joins</li>
                <li><strong>Other Work:</strong> Brahmasutra (Vedanta Sutra), foundational Vedanta text</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Who Was Badarayana?</h2>
            <p>Badarayana is one of the most influential yet mysterious figures in Hindu philosophy. He authored the Brahmasutra (also called Vedanta Sutra), the foundational text of Vedanta philosophy that all later commentators, from Shankara to Ramanuja to Madhva, had to interpret.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>The Brahmasutra Connection</h3>
            <p>The Brahmasutra is a collection of terse aphorisms summarizing Upanishadic philosophy. It mentions the Bhagavad Gita by name, indicating that by Badarayana's time, the Gita existed as a recognized text. This suggests Badarayana worked with an already-compiled Gita or may have played a role in its final compilation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Evidence for Badarayana as Editor</h2>
            <p>Desai presents several reasons for identifying Badarayana as the Gita's final editor:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="scholarly-insight">
            <h4>1. Philosophical Sophistication</h4>
            <p>The Gita's final form displays a systematic organization that suggests editorial intelligence. The text moves from crisis (Arjuna's despair) through philosophical instruction to resolution (Arjuna's commitment to fight). This narrative structure may have been imposed on earlier, less organized materials.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="scholarly-insight">
            <h4>2. Harmonization Efforts</h4>
            <p>Certain passages seem designed to reconcile apparent contradictions. When the text says "all paths lead to Me" or presents multiple yogas as complementary rather than competing, this may be editorial smoothing of originally conflicting positions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="scholarly-insight">
            <h4>3. Brahmasutra Parallels</h4>
            <p>The Gita's philosophical organization parallels the Brahmasutra's approach: presenting multiple perspectives, acknowledging objections, synthesizing seemingly opposed views. This suggests a common editorial mind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Editor's Task</h2>
            <p>What did the editor actually do? Desai proposes several levels of editorial intervention:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse-reference">
            <span class="verse-id">Editorial Activities</span>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ordering:</strong> Arranging the material into 18 chapters with logical progression</li>
                <li><strong>Transitional Material:</strong> Adding verses to connect disparate sections</li>
                <li><strong>Framing:</strong> Creating the dialogue structure (Krishna and Arjuna)</li>
                <li><strong>Harmonizing:</strong> Adding passages that reconcile contradictory teachings</li>
                <li><strong>Embedding:</strong> Inserting the completed text into the Mahabharata narrative</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Genius of Synthesis</h2>
            <p>The editor's achievement was to create the impression of a unified teaching from diverse sources. The multiple paths (karma, jnana, bhakti) are presented not as contradictions but as complementary approaches for different temperaments. The shifts in philosophical framework are smoothed into an apparent progression.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="historical-context">
            <h4>Parallel Examples</h4>
            <p>Similar editorial synthesis appears in other ancient texts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Pentateuch's combination of J, E, D, and P sources</li>
                <li>The compilation of the Homeric epics from oral traditions</li>
                <li>The growth of the Mahabharata itself from earlier, smaller texts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In each case, editors created apparent unity from diverse sources while leaving traces of the original multiplicity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Remaining Seams</h2>
            <p>Despite editorial efforts, the seams remain visible to careful readers. The Gita's internal contradictions, shifts in audience and vocabulary, and varying philosophical frameworks all point to its composite origins. The editor unified but did not fully homogenize.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Why the Seams Weren't Eliminated</h3>
            <p>The editor may have preserved diversity intentionally, recognizing value in each perspective, or may have been constrained by the reverence already accorded to the source materials. Ancient editors often worked conservatively, adding and arranging rather than extensively rewriting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Four-Layer Gita</h2>
            <p>In Desai's analysis, the Gita has not three but four contributors:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline">
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Layer 1: Author One (~600 BCE)</h4>
                <p>126 verses on karma yoga for the educated elite</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Layer 2: Author Two (~500 BCE)</h4>
                <p>119 verses responding to Buddhist challenge</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Layer 3: Author Three (~300 BCE)</h4>
                <p>455 verses promoting bhakti for the masses</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Layer 4: Badarayana (~200 BCE - 200 CE)</h4>
                <p>Editorial work unifying the three sources</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="desai-quote">
            "Badarayana was not a mere compiler but a theological architect. He took three buildings and made them into one, adding corridors and smoothing transitions. His genius was to make the joins nearly invisible."
