            <h2>The Core Insight</h2>
            <p>We tend to judge wealth by what we see: nice cars, big houses, expensive clothes. But that's not wealth—that's spending. True wealth is what you don't see. It's the money that hasn't been converted into stuff.</p>
            <p>Wealth is the nice car not purchased. The diamonds not bought. The first-class upgrade declined. Wealth is financial assets that haven't yet been converted into the stuff you see.</p>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Rich vs. Wealthy</h3>
            <p><strong>Rich:</strong> Current income is high. You drive a nice car and live in a nice house—because you can afford the payments.</p>
            <p><strong>Wealthy:</strong> Accumulated assets. Money invested and saved. You might drive an ordinary car because you value what the unspent money represents: freedom, security, options.</p>
            <p>Someone can be rich without being wealthy, and wealthy without appearing rich. The difference is invisible from the outside.</p>

            <h4>The Millionaire Next Door</h4>
            <p>The book "The Millionaire Next Door" found that typical millionaires live surprisingly modest lives. They drive used cars, live in middle-class neighborhoods, and you'd never guess their net worth by looking at them.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, many people who look wealthy—fancy cars, designer clothes, big houses—have very little actual wealth. They're spending faster than they're earning.</p>

            <h2>Why This Confusion Matters</h2>
            <p>When we confuse spending with wealth, we make two mistakes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>We try to emulate the wrong people:</strong> We copy the spending habits of people who look rich, not realizing they might be in debt</li>
                <li><strong>We spend instead of save:</strong> We convert wealth into stuff, destroying the financial flexibility that wealth provides</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

                <h4>Visible "Wealth" (Spending)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Luxury cars</li>
                    <li>Designer clothes</li>

            <div class="comparison-item wealth">
                <h4>Real Wealth (Assets)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Investment accounts</li>
                    <li>Emergency savings</li>
                    <li>Retirement funds</li>
                    <li>No debt</li>

            <h2>The Exercise Analogy</h2>
            <p>Housel compares wealth to fitness. When you exercise, you want to be fit. But fit is a negative: it's the absence of extra weight, the absence of weakness. You can't point to fit the way you can point to muscles.</p>
            <p>Similarly, wealth is a negative. It's the absence of spending. It's money that exists because it wasn't converted into something else. And like fitness, you can't see it from the outside.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h4>The Wealth Formula</h4>
            <p><strong>Wealth = What you earn - What you spend</strong></p>
            <p>It's the gap between income and spending that creates wealth, not high income alone. A person earning $50,000 who spends $40,000 is wealthier than someone earning $200,000 who spends $210,000.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>The Visibility Trap</h4>
            <p>We're hardwired to learn from what we see. But wealth is invisible. This creates a dangerous situation: we model our behavior on the visible spending of others, not realizing that what we're seeing is often the destruction of wealth, not its accumulation.</p>

            <h2>What Wealth Actually Buys</h2>
            <p>Real wealth—assets, not stuff—buys things that are hard to photograph:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Not worrying about unexpected expenses</li>
                <li><strong>Independence:</strong> Being able to say no to things you don't want to do</li>
                <li><strong>Options:</strong> Having the freedom to change course in life</li>
                <li><strong>Time:</strong> Not being forced to trade all your hours for money</li>
                <li><strong>Peace of mind:</strong> Sleeping well at night</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wealth is what you don't see:</strong> It's money that hasn't been spent, not stuff you own</li>
                <li><strong>Rich and wealthy are different:</strong> High income doesn't equal high net worth</li>
                <li><strong>Visible spending destroys wealth:</strong> Every purchase converts wealth into stuff</li>
                <li><strong>Don't model visible spenders:</strong> People who look rich may not be wealthy at all</li>
                <li><strong>Value the invisible benefits:</strong> Security, freedom, and peace of mind don't photograph well, but they matter most</li>
            </ul>
