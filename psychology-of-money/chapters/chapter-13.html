        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Core Insight</h2>
            <p>The most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to plan. Room for error—often called margin of safety—is the only effective way to safely navigate a world that is governed by odds, not certainties.</p>
            <p>You can be optimistic about the future and still plan for things to go wrong. In fact, the most optimistic people are the ones who take the most precautions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Why Room for Error Matters</h3>
            <p>In a world of probabilities rather than certainties, you need a gap between what could happen and what you need to happen in order to be okay. This gap is your room for error.</p>
            <p><strong>Without it:</strong> A single bad outcome can destroy you</p>
            <p><strong>With it:</strong> You can survive the inevitable surprises and keep playing the game</p>
        </div>

            <h4>Benjamin Graham's Wisdom</h4>
            <p>Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett's mentor, introduced the concept of "margin of safety" in investing. His idea: when you're making decisions based on estimates about the future, you should build in a buffer because your estimates will often be wrong.</p>
            <p>If a stock looks fairly priced at $100, don't pay $100. Pay $70 so you're still okay even if your analysis was off.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="housel-quote">
            "Room for error lets you endure a range of potential outcomes, and endurance lets you stick around long enough to let the odds of benefiting from a low-probability outcome fall in your favor."

            <h2>The Math of Survival</h2>
            <p>Consider the difference between different success rates over time:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="math-box">
            <h4>The Power of Avoiding Ruin</h4>
            <p>95% success rate per year, over 20 years = 36% chance of survival</p>
            <p>99% success rate per year, over 20 years = 82% chance of survival</p>
            <p><strong>Even small improvements in avoiding disaster dramatically improve long-term outcomes.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Where to Build Room for Error</h2>
            <p>Room for error should be built into every aspect of your financial life:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h4>Financial Margin of Safety</h4>
            <p><strong>Savings:</strong> More than you think you need, for situations you can't predict</p>
            <p><strong>Spending:</strong> Below your means, so unexpected expenses don't derail you</p>
            <p><strong>Debt:</strong> Less than you can handle, so you're okay if income drops</p>
            <p><strong>Investments:</strong> Diversified, so no single failure wipes you out</p>
            <p><strong>Career:</strong> Skills that transfer, so you have options if things change</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Optimism vs. Overconfidence</h2>
            <p>There's an important distinction between optimism and overconfidence:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Optimism:</strong> Believing things will generally work out well over time</li>
                <li><strong>Overconfidence:</strong> Believing you know exactly how and when they'll work out</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can be optimistic about the long-term direction while being humble about the specific path. Building room for error is what lets you stay optimistic—because you can survive the bumps along the way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>The Leverage Trap</h4>
            <p>Leverage (borrowing to invest) eliminates room for error. When you're leveraged, even small downturns can wipe you out. You might be right about the direction but wrong about the timing—and in finance, being early is the same as being wrong.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Russian Roulette with Financial Planning</h2>
            <p>Housel uses the analogy of Russian roulette. Even with a gun that has a thousand chambers and only one bullet, you shouldn't play. The expected outcome might be positive (999/1000 chance of winning the prize), but the downside—death—is too catastrophic.</p>
            <p>The same logic applies to financial planning. Some risks shouldn't be taken regardless of the expected value because the potential downside is too severe.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Save more than feels necessary:</strong> You'll be grateful when something unexpected happens</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid debt for consumption:</strong> It eliminates your buffer</li>
                <li><strong>Don't rely on optimistic projections:</strong> Assume things will take longer and cost more</li>
                <li><strong>Have backup plans:</strong> What if your primary plan fails?</li>
                <li><strong>Test your assumptions:</strong> What if I'm wrong about X?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Plan for the plan to fail:</strong> The most important part of any plan is accounting for what could go wrong</li>
                <li><strong>Margin of safety is essential:</strong> Build buffer into every financial decision</li>
                <li><strong>Survival enables success:</strong> You need to be around to capture long-term gains</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid catastrophic risks:</strong> Some downsides are too severe regardless of odds</li>
                <li><strong>Optimism needs humility:</strong> Be hopeful about direction, humble about the path</li>
