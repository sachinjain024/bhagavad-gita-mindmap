            <h2>The Core Insight</h2>
            <p>Everything worthwhile has a price. The price of investing success is volatility, uncertainty, and doubt. Most people try to avoid paying this price, looking for shortcuts or strategies that minimize discomfort. But the price is unavoidable—you either pay it or you don't get the reward.</p>
            <p>The key is viewing this price as a fee to be paid, not a fine to be avoided.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Fee vs. Fine</h3>
            <p><strong>Fee mindset:</strong> Volatility is the admission price for long-term returns. You pay it willingly because the alternative (not investing) is worse.</p>
            <p><strong>Fine mindset:</strong> Volatility is a punishment to be avoided. This leads to selling during downturns, market timing, and worse long-term outcomes.</p>
            <p>The only difference is perspective, but it makes all the difference in behavior.</p>
        </div>

            <h4>The Disneyland Analogy</h4>
            <p>When you go to Disneyland, you pay an entrance fee. The fee is high, but you pay it because the experience is worth it. You don't call it a "fine" for wanting to have fun.</p>
            <p>Market volatility works the same way. The price of participating in market returns is enduring market drops. It's not a penalty—it's the cost of admission.</p>

            <h2>The Price of Stock Market Returns</h2>
            <p>The S&P 500 has averaged about 10% returns over the long term. But that return comes with a price:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="math-box">
            <h4>The Cost of Admission</h4>
            <p>Since 1900, the U.S. stock market has:</p>
            <p>- Lost at least 10% about once every two years</p>
            <p>- Lost at least 20% about once every seven years</p>
            <p>- Lost at least 30% about once every decade</p>
            <p><strong>This is the price. If you're not willing to pay it, you shouldn't expect the reward.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why We Avoid the Price</h2>
            <p>The problem is that market downturns feel like something going wrong, not like paying a price. This makes them psychologically different from other costs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fear:</strong> Downturns trigger primal fear that's hard to override with logic</li>
                <li><strong>Uncertainty:</strong> You never know if the decline will get worse</li>
                <li><strong>Social pressure:</strong> Headlines scream that something is broken</li>
                <li><strong>Loss aversion:</strong> Losses feel twice as bad as equivalent gains feel good</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h4>The Alternative to Paying the Price</h4>
            <p>You can avoid volatility by keeping money in cash or low-risk assets. But then you pay a different price: lower long-term returns, inflation erosion, and not meeting your financial goals.</p>
            <p><strong>There is no free lunch.</strong> Every choice has a cost. The question is which cost you're willing to pay.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Different Games, Different Prices</h2>
            <p>Different investment approaches have different prices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Long-term investing:</strong> Price is watching your portfolio drop sometimes. Reward is long-term growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Day trading:</strong> Price is constant stress, time, and usually money. Reward is the thrill and rare big wins.</li>
                <li><strong>Real estate:</strong> Price is illiquidity, management hassles, and capital commitment. Reward is tangible assets and rental income.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>None of these prices is wrong—they're just different. The mistake is expecting rewards without paying any price.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>The Search for Free Lunches</h4>
            <p>Many investors spend their careers looking for strategies that offer high returns with no volatility. These don't exist. When someone claims to have found one, they're either misunderstanding the risks, lying, or running a scam.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Reframing the Price</h2>
            <p>When markets drop, try reframing your thinking:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Instead of:</strong> "I'm losing money"</li>
                <li><strong>Try:</strong> "I'm paying the admission fee for long-term returns"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This simple mental shift can be the difference between panic selling and staying the course. And staying the course is usually what determines long-term success.</p>
