        <div class="chapter-meta">Understanding Why People Make Different Financial Decisions</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Core Insight</h2>
            <p>People do some crazy things with money. But no one is crazy. Everyone makes financial decisions based on their own unique experiences that make sense to them in the moment. Your personal history with money shapes approximately 80% of how you think the world works, even though it represents only 0.00000001% of what has actually happened.</p>
            <p>This is why a person born into poverty thinks about risk and reward differently than a trust fund child. Neither is right or wrong—they're just working with different mental models formed by vastly different experiences.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>The Experience Gap</h3>
            <p>A person who grew up in poverty, one who grew up during a time of high inflation, one who grew up during a stock market boom, and one who grew up during a recession will all have fundamentally different views about money. And all of their views will be completely rational to them based on their experiences.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Historical Context Matters</h2>
            <p>Economists Ulrike Malmendier and Stefan Nagel studied how people invest based on their generational experiences. They found that people's lifetime investment decisions are heavily tied to the experiences they had in their own generation—especially early in their adult lives.</p>
            <p>If you grew up when inflation was high, you're less likely to invest in bonds as an adult. If you grew up during a stock market boom, you're more likely to invest in stocks. This isn't irrational—it's deeply human.</p>

            <h4>The Lottery Ticket Example</h4>
            <p>Low-income households spend on average $400 per year on lottery tickets—four times the amount of the highest-income groups. Is this crazy? Not when you understand that for many, a lottery ticket is the only ticket to a dream that feels out of reach any other way. In a world where you can't imagine saving enough to change your circumstances, a lottery ticket represents hope.</p>

            <h2>The Stock Market Through Generations</h2>
            <p>Consider the vastly different experiences people have had with the stock market:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h4>Generational Market Experiences</h4>
            <p><strong>Born in 1970:</strong> The S&P 500 increased almost 10-fold (adjusted for inflation) during your teenage years and twenties. Stocks seem like amazing wealth builders.</p>
            <p><strong>Born in 1950:</strong> The market went almost nowhere during your teenage and early adult years. You might view stocks with skepticism.</p>
            <p><strong>Born in 1930s:</strong> You lived through the Great Depression. The very idea of stocks might terrify you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <p>Understanding that no one is crazy has profound implications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> Before judging someone's financial decisions, consider what experiences shaped their worldview</li>
                <li><strong>Self-awareness:</strong> Recognize that your own views are colored by your experiences, not universal truths</li>
                <li><strong>Humility:</strong> What seems irrational to you might be perfectly rational to someone with different experiences</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>The Danger of Judging Others</h4>
            <p>It's easy to say "you should do X" with money. But we often don't know what experiences shaped someone's relationship with money. A person who seems irrationally conservative might have watched their parents lose everything. A person who seems recklessly aggressive might have never experienced a market crash. Neither is crazy—they're just human.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Spreadsheet vs. Reality</h2>
            <p>Spreadsheets are good at calculating the optimal financial strategy. But spreadsheets don't have feelings, families, or histories. Real people do. And real people make decisions based on what lets them sleep at night, which is often very different from what maximizes returns on paper.</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No one is crazy:</strong> Everyone's financial decisions make sense to them based on their experiences</li>
                <li><strong>Experience shapes belief:</strong> When and where you grew up dramatically influences how you think about money</li>
                <li><strong>Empathy is essential:</strong> Before judging financial decisions, consider the experiences behind them</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledge =/= Experience:</strong> You can study financial history, but you can't feel what it was like to live through the Great Depression</li>
                <li><strong>Be humble:</strong> Your financial worldview is just one of many valid perspectives shaped by one tiny slice of history</li>
            </ul>
