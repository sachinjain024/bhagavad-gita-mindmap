            <h2>The Core Insight</h2>
            <p>There is no limit to what people with money will risk to get more money. The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving. Modern capitalism is a pro at two things: generating wealth and generating envy. But life isn't any fun without a sense of enough.</p>
            <p>Happiness = Results - Expectations. If your expectations keep rising as fast as your results, you'll never be happy with what you have.</p>

            <h4>Rajat Gupta's Downfall</h4>
            <p>Rajat Gupta was a CEO of McKinsey—one of the most prestigious positions in the business world. He had a net worth of around $100 million. Yet he risked it all for insider trading, ultimately ending up in prison.</p>
            <p>Why would someone worth $100 million risk everything for a little more? Because he wasn't comparing himself to the average person. He was comparing himself to billionaires. And compared to them, $100 million felt like not enough.</p>

            <h2>Bernie Madoff's Tragedy</h2>
            <p>Bernie Madoff's legitimate, legal trading business was making $25-50 million per year. This should have been enough to live extraordinarily well. But he started a Ponzi scheme that eventually destroyed everything—his wealth, his reputation, his freedom, and his family.</p>
            <p>The question isn't "why would someone do this?" It's "why would someone who already has so much risk it all for more?"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Social Comparison is the Thief of Joy</h3>
            <p>The problem with social comparison is that the ceiling keeps rising. When you make partner at a law firm, you compare yourself to other partners. When you become a millionaire, you compare yourself to other millionaires. At each level, there's always someone who has more.</p>
            <p>A rookie baseball player making $500,000 might be jealous of a star making $20 million. But that star might be jealous of a hedge fund manager making $200 million. And that hedge fund manager might be jealous of a tech founder worth $2 billion.</p>

            <h4>The Ultimate Risk</h4>
            <p>The point at which most people feel rich is the point where they compare themselves to the next rung up—and feel poor again. The danger is that if you can't stop, you'll eventually take risks that threaten everything you've built. There's no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don't have and don't need.</p>

            <h2>Four Things to Keep in Mind</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h4>1. The Hardest Thing is Knowing When to Stop</h4>
            <p>The goalpost keeps moving because it's easy to forget what you originally wanted. Success brings new desires, new comparisons, new reasons why you need more.</p>

            <h4>2. Social Comparison Will Always Haunt You</h4>
            <p>The only way to win is not to play. At every level of income, there's someone above you. If you measure yourself by relative wealth, you'll never feel wealthy.</p>

            <h4>3. "Enough" is Not Too Little</h4>
            <p>Having "enough" doesn't mean a life of frugality. It means having a sense of independence, autonomy, and doing what you want. That's actually quite a lot.</p>

            <h4>4. The Worst Consequences are Permanent</h4>
            <p>Gupta and Madoff didn't just lose money—they lost their freedom, their families, and their reputations. Some risks are never worth taking because the downside is too severe.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Knowing Your Enough</h2>
            <p>Everyone's "enough" is different, but knowing what it is for you is essential. Without it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You'll take risks that could destroy what you already have</li>
                <li>You'll compare yourself to people you shouldn't compare yourself to</li>
                <li>You'll never be satisfied no matter how much you accumulate</li>
                <li>You'll sacrifice things that truly matter for things that don't</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Define your "enough":</strong> Without knowing when you've won, you can never stop playing</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid social comparison:</strong> There's always someone richer; measuring by relative wealth is a losing game</li>
                <li><strong>Remember what you're risking:</strong> Reputation, freedom, family, and happiness are more valuable than incremental wealth</li>
                <li><strong>Happiness = Results - Expectations:</strong> If expectations rise as fast as results, you'll never be satisfied</li>
                <li><strong>Some risks aren't worth taking:</strong> The downside of some gambles is too permanent to justify any upside</li>
            </ul>
