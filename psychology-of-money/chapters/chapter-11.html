            <h2>The Core Insight</h2>
            <p>You're not a spreadsheet. You're a person. A flawed, emotional, complicated person. Aiming to be mostly reasonable works better than trying to be coldly rational. A reasonable strategy you can stick with beats an optimal strategy you'll abandon.</p>
            <p>The best financial plan is not the one that maximizes returns—it's the one you can actually follow through tough times.</p>
        </div>

            <h3>Rational vs. Reasonable</h3>
            <p><strong>Rational:</strong> The mathematically optimal strategy, regardless of how it makes you feel</p>
            <p><strong>Reasonable:</strong> A strategy that makes sense to you and that you can stick with through thick and thin</p>
            <p>Academic finance is devoted to finding the rational strategy. Real-world success comes from finding a reasonable one.</p>

            <h4>The Fever Example</h4>
            <p>Fevers are actually your body's rational response to infection—the heat kills bacteria. But a fever is miserable. So we take medicine to reduce it, even though that's technically working against our body's optimal strategy.</p>
            <p>This is rational. But it's also reasonable to reduce your suffering. In finance, the same logic applies: sometimes the "suboptimal" strategy is the right choice because it's the one you can live with.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="housel-quote">
            "Do not aim to be coldly rational when making financial decisions. Aim to just be pretty reasonable. Reasonable is more realistic and you have a better chance of sticking with it for the long run, which is what matters most."

        <div class="comparison-box">
            <div class="comparison-item rich">
                <h4>Purely Rational</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>100% stocks (higher long-term returns)</li>
                    <li>No emergency fund (low returns on cash)</li>
                    <li>Maximize leverage</li>
                    <li>Never pay off low-interest debt</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-item wealth">
                <h4>More Reasonable</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stock/bond mix (you can sleep at night)</li>
                    <li>Emergency fund (peace of mind)</li>
                    <li>Manageable debt levels</li>
                    <li>Pay off mortgage for psychological benefit</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Home Ownership Example</h2>
            <p>From a purely rational standpoint, owning a home often doesn't make financial sense. Renting and investing the difference can yield higher returns. But home ownership provides something hard to quantify: stability, pride, community connection.</p>
            <p>Telling someone not to buy a house because the math doesn't work ignores that humans aren't spreadsheets. The psychological benefits of ownership might be worth the financial cost.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h4>What You Can Stick With</h4>
            <p>The best investment strategy is not the one with the highest expected return. It's the one you can maintain through:</p>
            <ul style="color: #e2e8f0; list-style: disc; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
                <li>Market crashes that feel terrifying</li>
                <li>Periods of underperformance that test your faith</li>
                <li>Life events that stress your finances</li>
                <li>Friends bragging about their returns</li>
                <li>Decades of time when anything can happen</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Love Your Investments</h2>
            <p>Housel argues there's something to be said for loving your investments. If you're passionate about a company and genuinely enjoy following it, you're more likely to stick with it through downturns. Pure optimization misses this.</p>
            <p>The same applies to your career: a job you love that pays less might make you happier and more successful in the long run than a job you hate that pays more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>The Danger of Optimization</h4>
            <p>The pursuit of the optimal strategy can paralyze you with analysis. Or worse, it can lead you to a strategy that's theoretically perfect but practically impossible to maintain. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Making Peace with Good Enough</h2>
            <p>A reasonable financial life involves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accepting that your strategy won't be mathematically optimal</li>
                <li>Prioritizing what helps you sleep at night</li>
                <li>Making decisions your future self won't regret</li>
                <li>Finding the balance between return and peace of mind</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reasonable beats rational:</strong> A strategy you can stick with beats one you'll abandon</li>
                <li><strong>You're not a spreadsheet:</strong> Emotions, relationships, and peace of mind matter</li>
                <li><strong>Psychology counts:</strong> The "right" strategy is the one that works for your psychology</li>
                <li><strong>Good enough is good enough:</strong> Don't let perfect be the enemy of good</li>
                <li><strong>Sleep matters:</strong> If your strategy keeps you up at night, it's not the right strategy</li>
