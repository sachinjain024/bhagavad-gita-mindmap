        <h1>The Psychology of Money</h1>
        <div class="authors">by Morgan Housel</div>

            <h2>Understanding the Book</h2>
            <p><strong>Total: 20 Chapters + Postscript</strong></p>
            <p>In <em>The Psychology of Money</em>, Morgan Housel shares 20 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money. The book argues that financial success is not about what you know—it's about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to smart people.</p>
            <p>The central insight: <strong>Doing well with money has little to do with intelligence and a lot to do with behavior.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="philosophy">
            <blockquote>"The premise of this book is that doing well with money has a little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people."</blockquote>

            <h3>Core Principles of The Psychology of Money</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Behavior Over Intelligence:</strong> Financial success is not about IQ; it's about how you behave with money</li>
                <li><strong>Time is Everything:</strong> Compounding works best when you give it decades, not years</li>
                <li><strong>Enough is Key:</strong> Knowing when you have enough prevents the risk that destroys you</li>
                <li><strong>Wealth is Hidden:</strong> True wealth is what you don't spend, not what you display</li>
                <li><strong>Room for Error:</strong> The most important part of any plan is planning for things to not go as planned</li>
                <li><strong>Freedom is the Goal:</strong> The highest dividend money pays is control over your time</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="key-teachings">
            <h3>Key Themes of the Book</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal History Matters:</strong> Your experiences with money shape your beliefs about risk, reward, and what money means. No one is crazy—they're making decisions based on their unique experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Luck and Risk are Siblings:</strong> Success requires acknowledging the role of luck in your wins and risk in others' failures. Humility and compassion follow from this recognition.</li>
                <li><strong>Compounding is Counterintuitive:</strong> $81.5 billion of Warren Buffett's $84.5 billion net worth came after his 65th birthday. Time in the market beats timing the market.</li>
                <li><strong>Savings = Freedom:</strong> Your savings rate matters more than your returns. Savings without a spending goal gives you flexibility and options—the things that make you happy.</li>
                <li><strong>Reasonable > Rational:</strong> Making financial decisions you can stick with beats optimizing on a spreadsheet. You have to be able to sleep at night.</li>
