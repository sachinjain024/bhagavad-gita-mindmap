        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 3: Who Are You?</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part I: Awakening Consciousness</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>This chapter poses the most fundamental question of all spiritual inquiry: Who are you? Singer guides you through a process of elimination, showing that you are not any of the things you typically identify with.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Most Important Question</h2>
            <p>Who are you? This seems like a simple question, but it's actually the deepest question a human being can ask. Most people answer with their name, their job, their roles, their beliefs, or their personality traits. But Singer asks us to look more closely—are any of these things really <em>you</em>?</p>

            <p>If you were asked who you are and you couldn't answer with anything external—no name, no occupation, no relationships, no history—what would you say? This inquiry is not philosophical wordplay; it's a doorway to discovering your true nature.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "You're not who you think you are. You are the one who is thinking."
                <div class="attribution">— Michael A. Singer</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>You Are Not Your Body</h2>
            <p>The most obvious answer to "Who am I?" is "I am this body." But look more closely. You say "my body" as if you own it, as if it belongs to you. Who is the "me" that has the body? Your body changes constantly—every cell is replaced over time—yet you remain. You were a child, a teenager, and now an adult, but something continuous observes all these changes.</p>

            <p>When you look at your hand, there is a subject (you) observing an object (the hand). This means you cannot be the hand. The same logic applies to every part of your body—you can observe it, which means you are the observer, not the observed.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Anything you can observe cannot be you. You are the observer, not the observed. This simple principle, when truly understood, revolutionizes your sense of self.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>You Are Not Your Thoughts</h2>
            <p>If you're not the body, perhaps you are your thoughts? But we've already seen that you can observe your thoughts. They come and go, but you remain. Thoughts arise without your choosing them—who is it that notices when a thought appears?</p>

            <p>Your thoughts change constantly based on mood, circumstance, and random associations. But the awareness in which thoughts appear doesn't change. It's always there, always watching, always knowing that thoughts are happening.</p>

            <p>You don't have to believe every thought that arises. You don't have to follow every mental tangent. Thoughts are events that happen within you, like clouds passing through the sky. You are the sky, not the clouds.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>You Are Not Your Emotions</h2>
            <p>Emotions feel very personal, very "me." When you're angry, it feels like <em>you</em> are angry. But notice: you can observe emotions arising. You can feel fear coming up and watch it intensify or subside. Who is watching?</p>

            <p>Emotions pass through you. They arise, peak, and dissolve. You say "I'm having a feeling" or "This emotion is passing through me"—the language itself reveals that emotions are experiences you have, not what you are.</p>

            <div class="metaphor-box">
                <h4>The Cinema Screen</h4>
                <p>Imagine you are the screen in a movie theater. All kinds of images appear on you—happy scenes, scary scenes, dramatic scenes. But the screen itself is never affected. It doesn't become happy or scared. It simply allows all images to appear. You are like that screen—the unchanging witness of all experiences.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Subject-Object Exercise</h2>
            <p>Singer offers a simple but profound exercise: notice that in every experience, there is something being experienced (the object) and something doing the experiencing (the subject). You are always the subject.</p>

            <p>You see a tree—you are the seer, not the tree. You feel sadness—you are the one feeling, not the sadness itself. You think a thought—you are aware of the thought, not the thought. No matter what arises in experience, you are always that which is aware of it.</p>

            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Practice: The Subject-Object Inquiry</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Notice any object in your awareness—a sound, a thought, a sensation</li>
                    <li>Recognize that you are aware of it</li>
                    <li>Ask: "Can I be aware of the one who is aware?"</li>
                    <li>Notice that awareness itself cannot be made into an object</li>
                    <li>Rest in this recognition that you are the awareness, not any object within it</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Seat of Consciousness</h2>
            <p>Singer introduces the concept of the "seat of consciousness"—the place from which you observe everything. This seat is not a physical location but a point of awareness. From this seat, you watch thoughts, emotions, sensations, and the entire world go by.</p>

            <p>Most people are so identified with what's happening in their consciousness that they never notice they are sitting in this seat. They're lost in the movie instead of realizing they're the one watching it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="central-teaching">
            You are not your thoughts, emotions, or body.<br>
            You are the awareness in which all of these appear.
