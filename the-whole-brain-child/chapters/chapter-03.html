            <h2>The Two-Story House</h2>
            <p>Imagine the brain as a house with two floors. The downstairs contains the basic functions—things that happen automatically and keep us alive. The upstairs contains the more sophisticated functions—the things that make us truly human.</p>
            <p>Children's challenge: <strong>the upstairs isn't finished being built.</strong> And even in adults, the upstairs can temporarily "go offline" under stress.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="downstairs-brain">
            <h4>The Downstairs Brain (Brain Stem + Limbic System)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic functions:</strong> Breathing, heart rate, sleep/wake cycles</li>
                <li><strong>Fight-flight-freeze:</strong> Threat detection and survival responses</li>
                <li><strong>Big emotions:</strong> Anger, fear, distress</li>
                <li><strong>Impulses:</strong> Strong urges to act immediately</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The downstairs brain is primitive, reactive, and fully online from birth. It's designed to keep us alive, not to be reasonable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="upstairs-brain">
            <h4>The Upstairs Brain (Cerebral Cortex, especially Prefrontal)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thinking:</strong> Complex analysis and reasoning</li>
                <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Imagining future consequences</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional regulation:</strong> Calming big feelings</li>
                <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> Understanding others' perspectives</li>
                <li><strong>Morality:</strong> Knowing right from wrong</li>
                <li><strong>Body control:</strong> Inhibiting impulses</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The upstairs brain is sophisticated, thoughtful—and <strong>under construction until the mid-20s</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="brain-insight">
            <h4>Why Children "Flip Their Lids"</h4>
            <p>Dr. Siegel uses the metaphor of "flipping your lid." Make a fist with your thumb tucked inside your fingers. The thumb is the downstairs brain; the fingers folded over are the upstairs brain.</p>
            <p>When we get very upset, the fingers fly up—the upstairs brain goes offline. Now only the downstairs brain is running the show. This is why you can't reason with an extremely upset child (or adult): the reasoning part is temporarily disconnected.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Understanding Tantrums</h2>
            <p>Not all tantrums are created equal. Understanding the difference between upstairs and downstairs tantrums changes how you respond:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="do-dont">
            <div class="not-that">
                <h4>Downstairs Tantrum</h4>
                <p>The child has completely "flipped their lid." They are overwhelmed, flooded, and the upstairs brain is offline.</p>
                <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Connection, safety, comfort. This is not a teaching moment—it's a nurturing moment. Wait for the brain to regulate before any discussion.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="do-this">
                <h4>Upstairs Tantrum</h4>
                <p>The child is making a choice to throw a fit. The upstairs brain is still engaged—they're being strategic.</p>
                <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Set clear limits. Don't negotiate with terrorism. The child can stop if they choose to—and they will if the tantrum isn't working.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="scenario">
            <h4>How to Tell the Difference</h4>
            <p>Ask yourself: Is my child capable of stopping right now if I offered something they really wanted? If yes, it's likely an upstairs tantrum. If no—if they're so flooded they couldn't stop even if they wanted to—it's a downstairs tantrum.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-box" data-strategy="Strategy #3">
            <h4>Engage, Don't Enrage</h4>
            <p>Appeal to the upstairs brain. Ask questions that invite thinking: "What's another way you could handle this?" Avoid triggering the downstairs brain with threats, yelling, or harsh punishment.</p>
            <p><strong>The goal:</strong> Keep the upstairs brain online so your child can make good decisions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue-example">
            <h4>Engaging the Upstairs Brain</h4>
            <div class="dialogue-line child">
                <span class="speaker">Child:</span> (Getting frustrated with homework) "This is stupid! I can't do it!"
            </div>
            <div class="dialogue-line parent">
                <span class="speaker">Option A (Enrages):</span> "Don't talk that way! You're not leaving this table until it's done!"
            </div>
            <p style="color: #b91c1c; margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic;">This triggers the downstairs brain. Now the child is in fight mode, focused on the conflict, not the homework.</p>
            <div class="dialogue-line parent">
                <span class="speaker">Option B (Engages):</span> "This looks really hard. What part is giving you trouble? Let's figure it out together."
            </div>
            <p style="color: #166534; margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic;">This engages the upstairs brain. The child feels supported and can think about the actual problem.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-box" data-strategy="Strategy #4">
            <h4>Use It or Lose It</h4>
            <p>The upstairs brain develops through use. Give your child lots of opportunities to exercise it: make decisions, manage emotions, consider others' feelings, negotiate, plan.</p>
            <p><strong>The science:</strong> Neural pathways strengthen with use. The more the upstairs brain practices, the stronger it gets.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Exercising the Upstairs Brain</h2>
            <p>You can't expect a child to have good self-control, empathy, or decision-making skills if they never practice them. Here are ways to exercise the upstairs brain:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="age-tips">
            <h4>Ways to Exercise the Upstairs Brain</h4>
            <p><strong>Decision-making:</strong> "Would you like to wear the red shirt or the blue shirt?"</p>
            <p><strong>Emotional regulation:</strong> "You seem really frustrated. What could help you calm down?"</p>
            <p><strong>Empathy:</strong> "How do you think your sister felt when that happened?"</p>
            <p><strong>Planning:</strong> "What do you think will happen if you do that?"</p>
            <p><strong>Ethics:</strong> "Was that fair? What would be the right thing to do?"</p>
            <p><strong>Body control:</strong> Games like freeze dance, Simon Says, or any activity requiring impulse control</p>
        </div>

        <div class="brain-concept">
            <h3>The Staircase Metaphor</h3>
            <p>The connection between upstairs and downstairs brain is like a staircase. Integration means the two floors are well-connected—emotions from downstairs can be regulated by thinking from upstairs, and decisions from upstairs are informed by emotional signals from downstairs.</p>
            <p>Your job is to help build this staircase through daily interactions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-box" data-strategy="Strategy #5">
            <h4>Move It or Lose It</h4>
            <p>When your child is stuck in a negative emotional state, physical movement can shift their brain state. Running, jumping, walking—any movement can help restore balance between upstairs and downstairs.</p>
            <p><strong>The science:</strong> Physical movement changes body chemistry and brain state, often shifting us out of stuck emotional patterns.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue-example">
            <h4>Move It or Lose It in Action</h4>
            <div class="dialogue-line child">
                <span class="speaker">Child:</span> (Grumpy, irritable, picking fights with sibling)
            </div>
            <div class="dialogue-line parent">
                <span class="speaker">Parent:</span> "You seem stuck in a grumpy mood. Let's go outside and shoot some hoops."
            </div>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-style: italic; color: #64748b;">Or for younger children: "Let's have a dance party!" or "Race you to the mailbox!"</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">After physical activity, the child's brain state has shifted, and they're often more regulated and receptive.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>When YOU Flip Your Lid</h2>
            <p>Parents flip their lids too. When you're exhausted, stressed, and your child pushes your buttons, your upstairs brain can go offline. You might yell, threaten, or do things you regret.</p>
            <p>What to do:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Recognize when you're about to flip (tight jaw, racing heart, hot face)</li>
                <li>Take a break if possible: "I need a moment to calm down."</li>
                <li>Model repair: "I'm sorry I yelled. My upstairs brain went offline."</li>
                <li>Use this as a teaching moment about brains for your child</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="whole-brain-summary">
            <h4>Remember: The Upstairs Is Under Construction</h4>
            <p>Expecting a child to consistently control their impulses, think ahead, and regulate their emotions is like expecting someone to run a marathon before they can walk. The upstairs brain won't be fully developed until the mid-20s.</p>
            <p>Your patience now—and the opportunities you provide for practice—are literally building your child's brain architecture.</p>
