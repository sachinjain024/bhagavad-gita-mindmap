        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Never-Sleeping Network</h2>
            <p>Human information networks have always been constrained by human limitations. We sleep, eat, get distracted, have emotions, and die. Computer networks have none of these constraints. They are <strong>relentless</strong>—operating at scales and speeds that are fundamentally inhuman.</p>
            <p>This isn't just "faster" or "more efficient." It represents a qualitative change in what information networks can do.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Human vs. AI Capabilities</h3>
            <p><strong>Speed:</strong> AI processes information millions of times faster than human thought</p>
            <p><strong>Scale:</strong> AI can handle billions of interactions simultaneously</p>
            <p><strong>Persistence:</strong> AI doesn't tire, forget, or need breaks</p>
            <p><strong>Consistency:</strong> AI applies the same criteria every time (for better or worse)</p>
            <p><strong>Patience:</strong> AI can pursue goals over timescales beyond human attention spans</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Speed Asymmetry</h2>
            <p>Consider what happens when AI systems interact with each other without human involvement. High-frequency trading algorithms already execute millions of trades per second—far too fast for any human to understand or intervene. Financial "flash crashes" can occur in milliseconds.</p>
            <p>As AI systems proliferate across domains—military, infrastructure, healthcare—their interactions will increasingly happen at speeds that exclude human participation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="historical-example">
            <h4>The 2010 Flash Crash</h4>
            <p>On May 6, 2010, the US stock market crashed nearly 1,000 points in minutes, then recovered almost as quickly. The cause? Automated trading algorithms interacting in unexpected ways. No human decided to crash the market—it emerged from the relentless, millisecond-speed interactions of machines.</p>
            <p>By the time humans understood what happened, it was already over.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Scale Problem</h2>
            <p>AI can maintain relationships—of a sort—with millions of entities simultaneously. A social media algorithm "knows" billions of users and tailors content for each one. A recommendation system tracks the preferences of entire populations.</p>
            <p>No human bureaucracy could achieve this level of individualized attention. But is it really "attention" at all? Or just sophisticated pattern-matching that mimics attention?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="network-box">
            <h4>What Scale Enables</h4>
            <p><strong>Personalization:</strong> Every user gets a uniquely tailored experience</p>
            <p><strong>Surveillance:</strong> Every action can be monitored and recorded</p>
            <p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Patterns invisible to humans become detectable at scale</p>
            <p><strong>Manipulation:</strong> Interventions can be tested on millions simultaneously</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Erosion of Human Attention</h2>
            <p>Harari argues that AI's relentlessness is wearing down human cognitive capacities. Social media platforms, powered by AI, are designed to capture and hold attention. They succeed—average screen time keeps rising—but at what cost?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduced Attention Spans:</strong> Constant stimulation trains brains for distraction</li>
                <li><strong>Diminished Deep Thinking:</strong> Complex problems require sustained focus that's harder to muster</li>
                <li><strong>Information Overload:</strong> More information than any human can process</li>
                <li><strong>Decision Fatigue:</strong> Endless choices exhaust the capacity to choose</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="harari-quote">
            "The AI never blinks first. It will wait patiently for you to check your phone, to click the link, to engage. It has infinite time and infinite patience. You don't."

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Always-On Surveillance</h2>
            <p>A human surveillance network—secret police, informants—has limits. People sleep. They get lazy. They have loyalties that conflict with their surveillance duties. AI surveillance has none of these limitations.</p>
            <p>Modern surveillance systems can:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="ai-insight">
            <h4>The Surveillance Stack</h4>
            <p><strong>Collect:</strong> Every digital interaction, camera feed, sensor reading</p>
            <p><strong>Store:</strong> Indefinitely, cheaply, in searchable formats</p>
            <p><strong>Analyze:</strong> Pattern recognition across billions of data points</p>
            <p><strong>Predict:</strong> Anticipate behavior before it occurs</p>
            <p><strong>Intervene:</strong> Automated responses without human review</p>
            <p>This creates possibilities for control that no previous regime could imagine.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Competitive Dynamic</h2>
            <p>Once some actors adopt relentless AI systems, others face pressure to follow. If your competitor uses AI trading algorithms, you must too—or be left behind. If an adversary uses AI surveillance, you may feel forced to match it.</p>
            <p>This creates arms races where the pace is set by machines, not humans. The result: systems become more powerful, faster, and less comprehensible—and humans become less central to their operation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>The Automation of War</h4>
            <p>Military AI is perhaps the most dangerous application. Autonomous weapons can identify and engage targets faster than any human could. In a war between AI systems, the side that waits for human approval may lose.</p>
            <p>This creates pressure to remove humans from the loop—to let machines make life-and-death decisions at machine speed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What Can Humans Still Do?</h2>
            <p>If AI is faster, more scalable, and more persistent, what role remains for humans in information networks? Harari suggests several:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Setting Goals:</strong> AI can optimize but can't decide what to optimize for</li>
                <li><strong>Making Value Judgments:</strong> Some decisions require wisdom, not just intelligence</li>
                <li><strong>Providing Meaning:</strong> Humans need meaning; AI doesn't</li>
                <li><strong>Creating Culture:</strong> Art, philosophy, and spirituality remain human domains (for now)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But these domains are shrinking as AI capabilities expand.</p>
