        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: What Is Information?</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part I: Human Networks | Foundations of the Information Age</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Redefining Information</h2>
            <p>Harari begins by challenging our assumptions about information. In the popular imagination, information is synonymous with facts, data, and truth. But this is a dangerously naive view. Information, in its most fundamental sense, is simply <strong>anything that connects</strong>.</p>
            <p>A lie is information. A myth is information. A conspiracy theory is information. They all serve to connect people, coordinate behavior, and shape the world—sometimes far more powerfully than dry facts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>The Naive View vs. The Sophisticated View</h3>
            <p><strong>Naive View:</strong> More information = more truth = better decisions = better world</p>
            <p><strong>Sophisticated View:</strong> Information can enlighten or deceive, unite or divide, liberate or enslave. The quality and structure of information networks matter more than the quantity of information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Information as Connection</h2>
            <p>Think about what information actually does in the world. A religious text connects millions of believers across centuries. A national anthem connects citizens to their country. A shared rumor connects a village. None of these need to be "true" in the scientific sense to be powerful.</p>
            <p>This is Harari's key insight: <em>the power of information lies not in its truth value but in its connective capacity</em>. The Bible connected billions of humans across millennia not because it contains empirically verifiable facts, but because it tells compelling stories that give life meaning and coordinate social behavior.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="harari-quote">
            "Information is the glue that holds human societies together. But it's a strange kind of glue—made as much of fiction as of fact."
            <cite>— Nexus, Chapter 1</cite>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Three Functions of Information</h2>
            <p>Harari identifies three primary functions that information serves in human societies:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="network-box">
            <h4>1. Representation</h4>
            <p>Information can represent reality—maps, scientific theories, news reports. This is what we typically think of as the "purpose" of information.</p>
            <h4>2. Connection</h4>
            <p>Information connects people who share it—believers in the same religion, citizens of the same nation, fans of the same team. The information doesn't need to be true to connect.</p>
            <h4>3. Coordination</h4>
            <p>Information coordinates action—laws, schedules, prices, signals. Again, truth is optional; what matters is that everyone acts on the same information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Paradox of Human Networks</h2>
            <p>Here's the paradox at the heart of human civilization: our greatest achievements depend on large-scale cooperation, and large-scale cooperation depends on shared information—but that shared information is often fictional.</p>
            <p>Consider money. A dollar bill is a piece of paper (or these days, a number in a database). It has no inherent value. Yet billions of people coordinate their daily activities based on shared beliefs about these fictional constructs. The same is true for corporations, nations, human rights, and countless other "imagined realities."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="historical-example">
            <h4>The Power of Shared Fictions</h4>
            <p>Chimpanzees can cooperate in groups of about 150 because they rely on personal knowledge—knowing each individual. Humans can cooperate in groups of millions because we share <em>stories</em> about gods, nations, and laws that exist only in our collective imagination.</p>
            <p>This isn't a weakness; it's a superpower. But it comes with risks: the same capacity that allows us to believe in human rights also allows us to believe in racial hierarchies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Truth Is Not Enough</h2>
            <p>Harari argues that we cannot simply counter misinformation with truth. Why? Because truth alone doesn't create the connections and coordination that societies need. You can't run a country on peer-reviewed scientific papers. You need stories, symbols, and shared beliefs.</p>
            <p>The challenge isn't to eliminate fiction from our information networks—that's impossible. The challenge is to build networks that can distinguish between useful fictions (like money and human rights) and harmful delusions (like conspiracy theories and totalitarian ideologies).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>The Information Age Fallacy</h4>
            <p>We assume that more information leads to better understanding. But the opposite can be true. Information overload can paralyze decision-making. Algorithmic curation can create filter bubbles. The sheer volume of information makes it easier, not harder, to find "evidence" for any belief, no matter how absurd.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Setting Up the Central Question</h2>
            <p>This chapter establishes the book's central concern: if information networks are the foundation of human civilization, and if those networks are now being transformed by artificial intelligence, what happens next?</p>
            <p>AI doesn't just process information faster—it generates, curates, and distributes information in ways that could fundamentally reshape human networks. Will this lead to greater wisdom or greater delusion? Better coordination or deeper division? That's what the rest of the book explores.</p>

            <h3>Key Insights from Chapter 1</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information ≠ Truth:</strong> Information is anything that connects people and coordinates behavior, regardless of its truth value</li>
                <li><strong>Fiction Is Functional:</strong> Shared fictions (religions, nations, money) enable large-scale human cooperation</li>
                <li><strong>The Naive View Is Dangerous:</strong> Assuming more information automatically leads to better outcomes ignores how information actually works</li>
                <li><strong>Connection Over Accuracy:</strong> The power of information lies in its ability to connect people, not in its correspondence to reality</li>
                <li><strong>The Central Challenge:</strong> Building information networks that can distinguish useful fictions from harmful delusions</li>
            </ul>
