            <h2>The New Cold War</h2>
            <p>The original Cold War divided the world along ideological and military lines. A new division is emerging—one based on technology and information infrastructure. Harari calls this potential divide "the Silicon Curtain."</p>
            <p>Will the world's information networks converge into a single global system, or fragment into rival technological empires? The answer will shape the 21st century as profoundly as the Iron Curtain shaped the 20th.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Two Possible Futures</h3>
            <p><strong>Global Network:</strong> A single interconnected information infrastructure spanning all nations—enabling unprecedented cooperation but also creating a single point of control</p>
            <p><strong>Fragmented Blocs:</strong> Rival technological ecosystems—US/Western, Chinese, perhaps others—with limited interoperability and constant competition</p>
            <p>Neither outcome is clearly better; both have profound implications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The US-China Technology Competition</h2>
            <p>The most visible fault line runs between the United States and China. Both are racing to dominate AI, semiconductors, 5G networks, and other foundational technologies. This competition extends beyond economics to geopolitics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standards Wars:</strong> Who sets the rules for how technology works</li>
                <li><strong>Supply Chain Control:</strong> Who makes the critical components</li>
                <li><strong>Data Access:</strong> Who collects and controls the information</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure Dominance:</strong> Whose systems run the world's networks</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="historical-example">
            <h4>The Huawei Controversy</h4>
            <p>The US campaign against Chinese telecom giant Huawei illustrates the stakes. The US argued that Huawei equipment in 5G networks could enable Chinese surveillance or sabotage. China saw the ban as an attempt to maintain American technological hegemony.</p>
            <p>Regardless of the security merits, the result is fragmentation: some countries use Chinese infrastructure, others American, and they may not be fully compatible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Internet's Fragmentation</h2>
            <p>The internet was designed to be global and open. Increasingly, it's becoming national and controlled. China's "Great Firewall" blocks foreign services. Russia is building capacity to disconnect from the global internet. Even democracies are implementing data localization laws.</p>
            <p>The vision of a single, borderless information space is giving way to a patchwork of national and regional networks with controlled gateways.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="network-box">
            <h4>Drivers of Fragmentation</h4>
            <p><strong>Security:</strong> Fear of foreign surveillance and cyber attacks</p>
            <p><strong>Economic:</strong> Desire to nurture domestic tech industries</p>
            <p><strong>Political:</strong> Need to control information flows to maintain power</p>
            <p><strong>Cultural:</strong> Concerns about foreign influence and values</p>
            <p><strong>Legal:</strong> Different rules for privacy, speech, and data</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The AI Advantage Question</h2>
            <p>Some argue that AI leadership will determine global power in the 21st century—that whoever masters AI will dominate economically and militarily. This creates intense pressure to win the "AI race," with implications for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Safety Trade-offs:</strong> Pressure to deploy AI quickly may override caution</li>
                <li><strong>Military Applications:</strong> Autonomous weapons development accelerates</li>
                <li><strong>Surveillance Export:</strong> AI control technologies spread globally</li>
                <li><strong>Standards Competition:</strong> Rival approaches to AI governance</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="harari-quote">
            "The race to AI supremacy could become the most dangerous arms race in history—not because the weapons are so destructive, but because we don't fully understand what we're racing toward."
            <cite>— Nexus, Chapter 11</cite>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Case for Global Governance</h2>
            <p>Harari argues that AI's global nature demands global governance. Climate change taught us that some problems transcend national borders. AI is similar:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>AI systems don't respect borders; their effects are global</li>
                <li>An AI arms race benefits no one and risks everyone</li>
                <li>Fragmented approaches create gaps that bad actors exploit</li>
                <li>Shared challenges (bias, safety, unemployment) require shared solutions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Yet global governance seems further away than ever, as great power competition intensifies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>The Coordination Failure</h4>
            <p>Even if all parties would benefit from AI governance cooperation, the structure of competition makes it hard to achieve. Each side fears that the other will cheat, gaining advantage while they self-limit. The result is a race to the bottom—less safety, more risk, worse outcomes for everyone.</p>
            <p>This is the classic tragedy of the commons, applied to humanity's most powerful technology.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Alternative Futures</h2>
            <p>Harari sketches several possible scenarios:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline">
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>American Hegemony</h4>
                <p>US maintains technological dominance; its rules become global standards; benefits accrue to those aligned with America</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Chinese Hegemony</h4>
                <p>China overtakes US in AI; its model of state-controlled technology spreads; surveillance capitalism meets surveillance communism</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Bifurcated World</h4>
                <p>Two (or more) technological blocs with limited interoperability; a new cold war fought through technology rather than territory</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Global Cooperation</h4>
                <p>International institutions emerge to govern AI; shared standards and safety measures; technology serves humanity rather than dividing it</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What's at Stake</h2>
            <p>The stakes go beyond geopolitics. The structure of global information networks will determine:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whether AI serves all humanity or just certain powers</li>
                <li>Whether AI safety measures are universal or patchy</li>
                <li>Whether AI promotes human flourishing or exploitation</li>
                <li>Whether future generations inherit an integrated world or warring camps</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="ai-insight">
            <h4>The Urgency of Choice</h4>
            <p>Harari emphasizes that these decisions are being made now, often by default rather than deliberate choice. Infrastructure being built today will shape options for decades. Standards adopted now become locked in. The window for steering AI's global trajectory is narrow and closing.</p>
