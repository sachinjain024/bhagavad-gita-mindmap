            <h2>The Promise of Complete Knowledge</h2>
            <p>Chapter 7 marks a turning point in the Gita. Having established the practices of karma yoga and meditation in previous chapters, Krishna now reveals the most profound knowledge about His own nature as the Supreme Absolute Truth. He promises that one who practices yoga with consciousness absorbed in Him will know Him completely, without doubt or remainder.</p>

            <p>Krishna reveals a striking statistic - among thousands of people, perhaps one strives for perfection, and among those who achieve perfection, hardly one knows Him in truth. This rarity of true knowledge makes the teaching of this chapter especially precious. It is not merely theoretical philosophy but realized wisdom that transforms understanding completely.</p>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="verse-number">Verse 7.3</div>
            <div class="verse-text">"Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth."</div>

            <h2>The Two Energies: Material and Spiritual</h2>
            <p>Krishna explains that His energy is divided into two categories - the inferior material energy consisting of eight elements (earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence, and false ego), and the superior spiritual energy which comprises the living entities. All material creation arises from these two energies, with the superior energy sustaining the inferior.</p>

            <p>This teaching is crucial for understanding reality. The material world is not separate from Krishna but is His lower energy, while living beings are His higher energy. Everything rests upon Krishna like pearls strung on a thread. He is the original source of both matter and spirit, the cause of all causes, beyond which there is no higher truth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="verse-number">Verse 7.7</div>
            <div class="verse-text">"O conqueror of wealth, there is no truth superior to Me. Everything rests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread."</div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Krishna in All Things</h2>
            <p>Krishna describes how He pervades all existence as the essence of everything. He is the taste in water, the light of the sun and moon, the sacred syllable Om in the Vedas, the sound in ether, the ability in humans, the original fragrance of the earth, the heat in fire, the life in all beings, and the intelligence of the intelligent. He is strength without desire and lust, and regulated desire not contrary to dharma.</p>

            <p>This revelation shows that Krishna is not distant but intimately present in every aspect of our experience. When we taste water, see light, hear sound, or think a thought, we are experiencing Krishna's energy. This understanding transforms ordinary perception into constant remembrance of the Divine, making every moment an opportunity for connection with the Supreme.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="verse-number">Verse 7.8-9</div>
            <div class="verse-text">"O son of Kunti, I am the taste of water, the light of the sun and the moon, the syllable Om in the Vedic mantras; I am the sound in ether and ability in man. I am the original fragrance of the earth, and I am the heat in fire. I am the life of all that lives, and I am the penances of all ascetics."</div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Bewildering Influence of Maya</h2>
            <p>Krishna explains why, despite His presence everywhere, people fail to recognize Him. The entire world is bewildered by the three modes of material nature - goodness, passion, and ignorance. These modes, which are also Krishna's energy, create a veil of illusion (maya) that is divine and difficult to overcome. Only those who surrender to Krishna can transcend this illusion and understand the truth.</p>

            <p>This teaching explains the paradox of spiritual ignorance. It is not that God is hiding or that knowledge is unavailable, but rather that material nature creates a powerful illusion that captivates consciousness. The solution is not more intellectual effort but devotional surrender. Those who take shelter of Krishna pierce through the illusion and see reality as it is.</p>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="verse-number">Verse 7.14</div>
            <div class="verse-text">"This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it."</div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Four Types of Devotees and Four Types of Non-Devotees</h2>
            <p>Krishna categorizes humanity into those who worship Him and those who don't. Among worshipers, four types are virtuous - the distressed, the seeker of wealth, the inquisitive, and the wise. Of these, the person of knowledge who is constantly engaged in pure devotion is the best, because Krishna is very dear to them and they are dear to Krishna.</p>

            <p>Among non-devotees are four types of sinful people who never surrender: the grossly foolish, the lowest of mankind, those whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and those of demonic nature. These categories are not eternal designations but descriptions of consciousness levels. Anyone can evolve from ignorance to knowledge, from materialism to devotion, through proper understanding and practice.</p>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="verse-number">Verse 7.17</div>
            <div class="verse-text">"Of these, the one who is in full knowledge and who is always engaged in pure devotional service is the best. For I am very dear to him, and he is dear to Me."</div>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="verse-number">Verse 7.19</div>
            <div class="verse-text">"After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare."</div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Attraction to Demigod Worship</h2>
            <p>Krishna explains why people worship demigods rather than the Supreme. Those whose intelligence is stolen by material desires approach various demigods, following particular rules and regulations according to their own natures. Krishna grants them faith in these deities, and they worship with that faith, ultimately obtaining their desired results - but these results come from Krishna alone.</p>

            <p>This teaching reveals the mechanics of desire and worship. People worship according to their level of understanding and desire. Those with limited desires worship limited deities for limited results. But the wise understand that all power comes from one source - Krishna - and they worship Him directly. The rewards of demigod worship are temporary, while devotion to Krishna brings eternal benefit.</p>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="verse-number">Verse 7.23</div>
            <div class="verse-text">"Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet."</div>

            <h2>The Veiled Supreme: Why Krishna Remains Hidden</h2>
            <p>In a profound revelation, Krishna explains that He is never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent because He is covered by His internal potency of yoga-maya. The world, bewildered by this illusion, does not know Him as the unborn and infallible Supreme Lord. This is not because Krishna chooses to hide capriciously, but because those absorbed in maya lack the spiritual vision to perceive Him.</p>

            <p>Krishna knows all beings - past, present, and future - but no one truly knows Him. This asymmetry exists because conditioned souls are covered by the dualities born of desire and hate, which arise from delusion. At the time of birth, all living entities fall into confusion. Only those who have ceased sinful activities and whose actions are pure can free themselves from this duality of delusion and worship Krishna with determination.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Chapter 7 reveals the personal nature of the Absolute Truth. Krishna is not an impersonal force or abstract principle but the Supreme Person who is the source, sustainer, and essence of all existence. He pervades everything, yet remains distinct; He is immanent yet transcendent. The teaching that hardly one in thousands knows Him in truth is both sobering and inspiring - sobering because it shows how rare real understanding is, inspiring because it reveals the preciousness of the spiritual path. The key to piercing maya's illusion is not intellectual prowess but humble surrender. When we recognize Krishna as the cause of all causes and surrender to Him, we transcend the bewilderment that covers the conditioned souls and enter into relationship with the Supreme Person who has been present in every experience of our lives, waiting to be recognized.</p>
