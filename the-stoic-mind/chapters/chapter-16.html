            <h2>The Fear Mislabel</h2>
            <p>When we feel fear before a new challenge, we often interpret it as a warning: "This is dangerous. I can't do this. I'm not ready." But this interpretation is usually wrong.</p>
            <p>The fear signal evolved to protect us from physical threats. It wasn't designed for public speaking, job interviews, or creative projects. <strong>The sensation of fear in modern contexts typically indicates unfamiliarity, not actual danger or incapacity.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h3>Reframing the Fear Response</h3>
            <p>When you feel nervous about stepping outside your comfort zone, practice this reframe:</p>
            <p><em>"This feels scary because it's unfamiliar, not because I'm incapable."</em></p>
            <p>The physical sensation remains, but its meaning changes entirely.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Stoic Practice of Voluntary Discomfort</h2>
            <p>The Stoics didn't just accept discomfort — they actively sought it. Seneca would periodically sleep on the floor, eat simple food, and wear rough clothes. Not as punishment, but as training.</p>
            <p>By voluntarily experiencing discomfort, they:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced fear of what might happen (they'd already survived it)</li>
                <li>Built tolerance for difficulty</li>
                <li>Appreciated their normal circumstances more</li>
                <li>Proved to themselves they could handle adversity</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="stoic-quote">
            <div class="quote-text">"Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: 'Is this the condition that I feared?'"</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Comfort Zone Expansion</h2>
            <p>The goal isn't to live in constant discomfort. It's to systematically expand what feels comfortable. Each time you do something scary and survive, that activity moves closer to your comfort zone.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start small:</strong> Take on challenges just beyond your current edge</li>
                <li><strong>Go regularly:</strong> Frequent small stretches beat occasional large leaps</li>
                <li><strong>Reflect after:</strong> Notice that you survived. Encode this as evidence of capability.</li>
                <li><strong>Increase gradually:</strong> As your zone expands, push slightly further</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Cost of Staying Comfortable</h2>
            <p>Comfort zones have another name: limitation zones. Everything you want that you don't have exists outside your current comfort zone. Growth, achievement, connection — they all require crossing that boundary.</p>
            <p>The temporary discomfort of expansion is the price of a larger life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="practice-exercise">
            <h4>Daily Practice: One Uncomfortable Thing</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Each day, do one small thing that makes you slightly uncomfortable</li>
                <li>Talk to a stranger. Share your work. Ask a question. Make a request.</li>
                <li>Notice the anticipatory fear, then notice how you survive the action</li>
                <li>Build a catalog of evidence: "I was scared, I did it anyway, I'm fine"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>What have you been avoiding because it feels scary? What would become possible if you did it anyway? What's the worst realistic outcome — and could you survive that?</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fear of the unfamiliar isn't a sign of incapacity</li>
                <li>Voluntary discomfort builds resilience and reduces fear</li>
                <li>Comfort zones are also limitation zones</li>
                <li>Systematic expansion through small stretches is sustainable</li>
                <li>Everything you want exists outside your current comfort zone</li>
