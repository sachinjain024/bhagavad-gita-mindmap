        <div class="chapter-meta">The Power of Deliberate Action</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Illusion of Hoping for Change</h2>
            <p>We often wish for different outcomes while maintaining the same behaviors. We want better health while eating poorly. We desire deeper relationships while scrolling through social media. We hope for career advancement while avoiding challenging work.</p>
            <p>The Stoics recognized this fundamental truth: <strong>your current actions are creating your future reality.</strong> If you don't like where you're headed, the only solution is to change what you're doing today.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h3>The Stoic Principle</h3>
            <p>You cannot control outcomes, but you can control your actions. And your actions, accumulated over time, shape the trajectory of your life. Change the inputs, and the outputs will follow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Power of Small Pivots</h2>
            <p>You don't need dramatic transformation. The Stoics understood that small, consistent changes compound. A ship adjusting its course by just one degree will end up in a completely different place after sailing for miles.</p>
            <p>Consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reading 10 pages daily instead of scrolling = 3,650 pages (roughly 12 books) per year</li>
                <li>One genuine conversation per day = 365 deeper connections per year</li>
                <li>15 minutes of focused work on a side project = a completed project in months</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Identifying What to Change</h2>
            <p>Not all actions are equal. Focus on high-leverage behaviors — those that disproportionately influence your trajectory:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Morning routines:</strong> How you start your day sets the tone for everything</li>
                <li><strong>Who you spend time with:</strong> You become the average of your closest associations</li>
                <li><strong>What you consume:</strong> Information shapes thought; thought shapes action</li>
                <li><strong>How you respond to difficulty:</strong> This defines your character over time</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="practice-exercise">
            <h4>Daily Practice: The Trajectory Check</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify one area where you want different results</li>
                <li>List your current behaviors in that area honestly</li>
                <li>Choose one small behavior to change this week</li>
                <li>Track it daily — awareness precedes change</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>If you continued your current daily habits unchanged for the next five years, where would you be? Is that where you want to go?</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your actions today are creating your tomorrow — there's no escaping this</li>
                <li>Small changes compound into massive differences over time</li>
                <li>Focus on high-leverage behaviors that disproportionately shape outcomes</li>
                <li>You can't control results, but you can control your inputs</li>
                <li>Honest assessment of current behaviors is the first step to change</li>
