        <div class="chapter-meta">Embracing Imperfect Progress</div>

        <div class="stoic-quote">
            <div class="quote-text">"How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself?"</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Perfection Trap</h2>
            <p>Perfectionism kills consistency. Here's how it works: You miss one day of your habit, and instead of simply resuming, you abandon it entirely. "I've already broken my streak, so why bother?" This all-or-nothing thinking is the enemy of lasting change.</p>
            <p>The Stoics aimed for virtue but accepted that perfection was impossible. Even Marcus Aurelius, with all his philosophical training, struggled daily with anger, judgment, and laziness. He didn't give up — he kept practicing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h3>The Stoic Reality</h3>
            <p>Progress is not a straight line. It's a messy zigzag that trends upward over time. What matters is not whether you stumble, but whether you get back up. The goal is <strong>consistency over perfection</strong> — showing up repeatedly, imperfectly, persistently.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Imperfect Consistency Wins</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Compound effect:</strong> 80% effort applied consistently beats 100% effort applied sporadically</li>
                <li><strong>Habit formation:</strong> Repetition builds neural pathways, even imperfect repetition</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Standards you can maintain are better than ideals you can't</li>
                <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Learning to recover from lapses is itself a crucial skill</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The "Never Miss Twice" Rule</h2>
            <p>Instead of aiming for perfect streaks, adopt this more realistic standard: <strong>never miss twice in a row.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Missed your morning workout? Do something active in the evening.</li>
                <li>Ate poorly today? Make your next meal healthy.</li>
                <li>Skipped your reading? Read even one page before bed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One miss is an accident. Two misses starts becoming a pattern. The goal is to interrupt the pattern before it forms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Recovering from Lapses</h2>
            <p>When you slip (and you will), the Stoic response is:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Notice without judgment:</strong> "I missed my practice yesterday."</li>
                <li><strong>Understand without excusing:</strong> "I was tired and chose comfort."</li>
                <li><strong>Recommit without drama:</strong> "Today, I continue."</li>
            </ol>
            <p>No self-flagellation. No "starting over Monday." Just a calm return to the path.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="practice-exercise">
            <h4>Daily Practice: The Minimum Viable Habit</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>For each habit you're building, define a "minimum viable" version</li>
                <li>Example: Full workout = 30 minutes. Minimum viable = 5 push-ups.</li>
                <li>On days when you can't do the full version, do the minimum</li>
                <li>The goal is to maintain the streak of showing up, not the streak of perfection</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>What habit or practice have you abandoned because you couldn't maintain it perfectly? What would it look like to resume it with more realistic expectations?</p>
