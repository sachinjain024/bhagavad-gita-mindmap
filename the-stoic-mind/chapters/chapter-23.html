            <h2>The Spark and the Flame</h2>
            <p>Motivation is exciting. It arrives with energy and enthusiasm, making us believe we can achieve anything. But motivation is a spark — bright, hot, and brief. It can ignite action, but it cannot sustain it.</p>
            <p>Consistency is the fuel that keeps the flame burning long after the initial spark has faded. <strong>What you do every day matters more than what you do occasionally.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h3>The Compound Effect of Consistency</h3>
            <p>Consistent small actions compound over time into remarkable results. This is simple math:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1% improvement daily = 37x improvement in a year</li>
                <li>1% decline daily = ending up at 3% of where you started</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The direction of your small, daily choices determines your destination.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Consistency is Hard</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Results lag behind actions:</strong> You don't see immediate payoff</li>
                <li><strong>Novelty fades:</strong> The exciting becomes mundane</li>
                <li><strong>Life interrupts:</strong> Emergencies, illnesses, and disruptions happen</li>
                <li><strong>Perfectionism sabotages:</strong> "I can't do it perfectly, so why bother?"</li>
                <li><strong>Comparison discourages:</strong> Others seem to progress faster</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Understanding these obstacles helps you plan around them.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Building Consistent Practice</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start absurdly small:</strong> Make the habit so easy you can't say no</li>
                <li><strong>Same time, same place:</strong> Routine reduces the need for decision-making</li>
                <li><strong>Never miss twice:</strong> One miss is a blip; two starts a pattern</li>
                <li><strong>Track visibly:</strong> A chain of X's becomes motivation itself</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on identity:</strong> "I am someone who does this" vs. "I'm trying to do this"</li>
                <li><strong>Forgive fast:</strong> Self-criticism after a lapse delays recovery</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Stoic Model</h2>
            <p>Marcus Aurelius wrote his Meditations as a daily practice — returning each day to the same principles, the same reminders, the same self-examinations. He didn't expect to "master" Stoicism and be done. He understood it as a lifelong daily practice.</p>
            <p>Excellence is not an act but a habit. You become what you repeatedly do.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="practice-exercise">
            <h4>Daily Practice: The Consistency Commitment</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose one behavior you want to make consistent</li>
                <li>Reduce it to a version that takes less than 5 minutes</li>
                <li>Attach it to an existing daily habit (after brushing teeth, before coffee)</li>
                <li>Track completion with a physical mark on a calendar</li>
                <li>Focus only on maintaining the chain, not on achieving outcomes</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>What would your life look like if you had been consistent with one important habit for the past five years? What could it look like five years from now if you started being consistent today?</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Motivation ignites but consistency sustains</li>
                <li>Small consistent actions compound into extraordinary results</li>
                <li>Make habits so small they're impossible to refuse</li>
                <li>Never miss twice — interrupt patterns before they form</li>
                <li>You become what you repeatedly do</li>
