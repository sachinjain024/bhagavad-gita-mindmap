            <h2>The Comparison Trap</h2>
            <p>We live in an age of unprecedented visibility into others' lives. Social media shows us curated highlights of thousands of people. We compare our behind-the-scenes to their highlight reels and inevitably feel inadequate.</p>
            <p>But even before social media, the Stoics warned against comparison. <strong>When you measure your life by someone else's standards, you guarantee dissatisfaction</strong> — because you're playing a game with rules you didn't choose and may not even agree with.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h3>The Stoic Standard</h3>
            <p>The only valid measure of a life, according to the Stoics, is virtue — living according to your own values, improving your character, and fulfilling your unique potential. Not wealth, not fame, not status. These are "indifferent" — not inherently good or bad.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why External Measures Fail</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Moving targets:</strong> External standards shift constantly; there's always someone with more</li>
                <li><strong>Context blindness:</strong> You don't see others' struggles, sacrifices, or starting points</li>
                <li><strong>Value misalignment:</strong> Others' goals may not reflect what you actually want</li>
                <li><strong>Control problems:</strong> Outcomes depend on factors beyond your control</li>
                <li><strong>Hedonic adaptation:</strong> Achievement by external measures quickly feels normal</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Creating Your Own Ruler</h2>
            <p>What would your life look like if you defined success entirely on your own terms? Consider measuring yourself by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Character growth:</strong> Am I becoming more patient, kind, wise, courageous?</li>
                <li><strong>Value alignment:</strong> Am I living according to what I believe matters?</li>
                <li><strong>Effort quality:</strong> Did I bring my best to today?</li>
                <li><strong>Relationship depth:</strong> Are my connections genuine and nurturing?</li>
                <li><strong>Inner peace:</strong> Can I be still with myself without anxiety?</li>
                <li><strong>Contribution:</strong> Am I leaving things better than I found them?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Comparing to Your Past Self</h2>
            <p>If you must compare, compare to who you were yesterday. This is the only fair comparison:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Same starting conditions</li>
                <li>Same resources and constraints</li>
                <li>Same fundamental nature</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The question isn't "Am I as successful as them?" but "Am I better than I was?"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="practice-exercise">
            <h4>Daily Practice: The Personal Scorecard</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Define 3-5 metrics that matter to you personally (not to impress others)</li>
                <li>At week's end, rate yourself only on these metrics</li>
                <li>Ignore external benchmarks entirely during this assessment</li>
                <li>Adjust your focus based on what your scorecard reveals</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>Whose standards have you been using to measure your life? If you could define success entirely for yourself, independent of what anyone else would think, what would it look like?</p>
        </div>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Comparison to others guarantees dissatisfaction</li>
                <li>External measures are moving targets you can never reach</li>
                <li>Define success according to your own values, not society's</li>
                <li>The only fair comparison is to your past self</li>
                <li>Virtue and character growth are the Stoic measures of a life</li>
