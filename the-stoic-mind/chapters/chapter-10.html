        <div class="stoic-quote">
            <div class="quote-text">"Make the best use of what is in your power, and take the rest as it happens."</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Dichotomy of Control</h2>
            <p>This is perhaps the most fundamental Stoic principle: some things are within our control, and some things are not. Our task is to clearly distinguish between the two and focus our energy accordingly.</p>
            <p><strong>Within your control:</strong> Your thoughts, judgments, desires, aversions, and actions.</p>
            <p><strong>Outside your control:</strong> Other people's opinions, external events, outcomes, the past, and the future.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h3>The Epictetus Framework</h3>
            <p>"Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Time Illusion</h2>
            <p>We often say "I don't have enough time." But everyone has the same 24 hours. The difference is focus — how we direct our limited attention.</p>
            <p>When we spend mental energy worrying about things outside our control, we're literally taking time and attention away from things we can actually influence. It's not a time problem; it's an allocation problem.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stoic-quote">
            <div class="quote-text">"It is not things that disturb us, but our judgments about things."</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Applying the Dichotomy</h2>
            <p>When facing any situation, ask yourself:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What can I control here?</strong> Focus your energy entirely on this.</li>
                <li><strong>What can I influence?</strong> Apply effort proportional to your influence.</li>
                <li><strong>What is completely outside my control?</strong> Accept this and release attachment to outcomes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This isn't passive resignation — it's strategic energy management. You fight where you can win and conserve resources elsewhere.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Common Misallocations of Focus</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Worrying about what others think of you (uncontrollable)</li>
                <li>Ruminating on past mistakes (unchangeable)</li>
                <li>Anxiously predicting future disasters (unknowable)</li>
                <li>Trying to change someone who doesn't want to change</li>
                <li>Obsessing over competition instead of your own performance</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="practice-exercise">
            <h4>Daily Practice: The Control Audit</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>List what you worried about today</li>
                <li>Categorize each item: Control / Influence / No Control</li>
                <li>For items you can control: What action can you take?</li>
                <li>For items you can't: Practice saying "This is not mine to control"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>How much of your mental energy this week went to things outside your control? What could you have accomplished if you'd redirected that energy to things within your power?</p>
        </div>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The dichotomy of control is the foundation of Stoic peace of mind</li>
                <li>You control your thoughts, judgments, and actions — not outcomes</li>
                <li>Time scarcity is often focus scarcity in disguise</li>
                <li>Energy spent on the uncontrollable is energy stolen from the controllable</li>
                <li>This isn't passive resignation — it's strategic focus</li>
            </ul>
