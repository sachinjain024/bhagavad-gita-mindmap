            <h2>The Attrition Game</h2>
            <p>Most people don't start. Of those who start, most don't continue. Of those who continue, most give up. By the time you reach the finish line, the competition has largely eliminated itself.</p>
            <p>This isn't cynicism — it's observation. The Stoics understood that simply enduring, simply persisting, is itself a powerful advantage. <strong>You don't always need to be the best. Sometimes you just need to be the one who didn't quit.</strong></p>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h3>The Persistence Advantage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Most don't start:</strong> Beginning puts you ahead of the majority</li>
                <li><strong>Most don't continue:</strong> Week two eliminates more competitors</li>
                <li><strong>Most give up:</strong> Year one thins the field dramatically</li>
                <li><strong>Few outlast difficulties:</strong> Each obstacle removes more people</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The last one standing often wins not through superior talent but through superior staying power.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Stoic View of Endurance</h2>
            <p>The Stoics faced exile, persecution, loss, and death. They developed practices specifically for endurance — not to avoid suffering but to bear it well. They understood that the capacity to persist through difficulty is trainable.</p>
            <p>Every hardship you endure builds your capacity for future hardship. This is why the Stoics didn't pray for easy lives; they trained for the ability to handle hard ones.</p>

            <h2>What Perseverance Requires</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Long-term vision:</strong> Keep your eyes on the horizon, not just the next obstacle</li>
                <li><strong>Short-term focus:</strong> Handle today; tomorrow will take care of itself</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional regulation:</strong> Don't let temporary feelings drive permanent decisions</li>
                <li><strong>Identity commitment:</strong> "I am someone who doesn't quit"</li>

            <h2>When to Quit vs. When to Persist</h2>
            <p>Perseverance isn't stubbornness. The Stoics also valued wisdom about when to let go. Consider quitting when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The goal itself is no longer meaningful to you</li>
                <li>Better opportunities require redirecting your energy</li>
                <li>You've gathered enough information to know the path is wrong</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But don't quit because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It's temporarily hard</li>
                <li>You're temporarily discouraged</li>
                <li>Others have doubts</li>
                <li>You haven't seen results yet</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="practice-exercise">
            <h4>Daily Practice: The Why Reminder</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Write down why you started your most important current pursuit</li>
                <li>Read this statement every morning before beginning work</li>
                <li>When you feel like quitting, read it again and ask: "Has anything fundamental changed?"</li>
                <li>Update your "why" as it evolves, but don't abandon the pursuit on a whim</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>Think of something meaningful you achieved. How close did you come to quitting? What kept you going? What would have happened if you'd stopped?</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Most competitors eliminate themselves through premature quitting</li>
