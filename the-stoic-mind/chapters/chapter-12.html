            <h2>Redefining Discipline</h2>
            <p>When we think of discipline, we often imagine iron willpower, rigid schedules, and flawless execution. But this image is counterproductive. It sets a standard so high that ordinary humans can't maintain it, leading to discouragement and abandonment.</p>
            <p>True discipline isn't about never failing. It's about <strong>always returning</strong>. It's not the perfect record; it's the unbroken pattern of resumption.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h3>Continuity Over Intensity</h3>
            <p>A river carves a canyon not through force but through persistence. Water isn't harder than rock — it's more continuous. Your discipline works the same way. Moderate effort applied without interruption accomplishes more than heroic effort applied sporadically.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Mathematics of Continuity</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>30 minutes daily = 182 hours per year</li>
                <li>60 minutes twice a week = 104 hours per year</li>
                <li>Same weekly total, but the daily approach wins because of the compound effect of continuity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Showing up every day, even briefly, maintains momentum, reinforces habit, and keeps you connected to the practice. Long gaps require rebuilding from scratch.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Building Continuity</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lower the bar:</strong> Make showing up so easy you can't fail</li>
                <li><strong>Protect the streak:</strong> Don't let a single miss become two</li>
                <li><strong>Schedule it:</strong> Put it in your calendar like any important appointment</li>
                <li><strong>Attach to triggers:</strong> Link new habits to existing routines</li>
                <li><strong>Track visibly:</strong> A simple calendar with X marks builds momentum</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Identity Shift</h2>
            <p>With enough continuity, your practices become part of who you are. "I'm someone who meditates" feels different from "I'm trying to meditate more." The former is identity; the latter is aspiration.</p>
            <p>Continuity creates identity. Identity reinforces continuity. This is the virtuous cycle you're building.</p>

            <h4>Daily Practice: The Two-Minute Rule</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose one habit you want to build</li>
                <li>Commit to doing it for only two minutes daily</li>
                <li>The goal isn't the two minutes — it's maintaining the chain</li>
                <li>Once the chain is strong, you can gradually extend</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>What positive practice have you maintained the longest in your life? What made that continuity possible? How can you apply those same factors to new habits?</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>

                <li>Small daily actions outperform large sporadic ones</li>
                <li>Lower the bar to maintain the streak</li>
                <li>Consistent practice eventually becomes identity</li>
