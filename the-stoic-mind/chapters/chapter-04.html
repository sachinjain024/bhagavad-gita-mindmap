            <h2>The Noise of the Ego</h2>
            <p>Ego announces itself. It needs validation, recognition, and constant reinforcement. It talks loudly about achievements, defends itself aggressively against criticism, and measures itself obsessively against others.</p>
            <p>True confidence, by contrast, is quiet. It doesn't need to prove anything because it knows what it knows. It can admit ignorance because its worth isn't threatened by gaps in knowledge.</p>

            <h2>The Quiet Power of Self-Awareness</h2>
            <p>The Stoics practiced relentless self-examination. Marcus Aurelius wrote his Meditations as private notes to himself, examining his flaws and reminding himself of principles. This wasn't self-flagellation — it was the foundation of genuine confidence.</p>
            <p>When you know yourself deeply — your strengths, weaknesses, values, and triggers — you don't need external validation. Your sense of worth comes from alignment with your own standards, not comparison with others.</p>

            <h2>Building True Confidence</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Do the work:</strong> Confidence comes from competence, and competence comes from practice</li>
                <li><strong>Face your fears:</strong> Each challenge overcome builds genuine self-trust</li>
                <li><strong>Accept your limitations:</strong> Knowing what you don't know is a form of wisdom</li>
                <li><strong>Stop comparing:</strong> Your only competition is yesterday's version of yourself</li>
                <li><strong>Practice silence:</strong> You don't need to prove anything in every conversation</li>

            <h4>Daily Practice: The Ego Check</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Notice when you feel the urge to defend yourself or prove a point</li>
                <li>Pause. Ask: "Is this confidence speaking, or ego?"</li>
                <li>If it's ego, let the moment pass without acting on it</li>
                <li>Journal instances where you caught yourself — awareness is the first step</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>When was the last time you felt genuinely confident without needing anyone else to notice or validate it? What were you doing? What made that possible?</p>
