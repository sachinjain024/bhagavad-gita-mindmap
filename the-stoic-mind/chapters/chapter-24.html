            <div class="quote-text">"Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present."</div>

            <h2>The Catastrophizing Mind</h2>
            <p>When things go wrong, the mind has a tendency to extrapolate. A bad meeting becomes "I'm failing at my career." A difficult conversation becomes "This relationship is doomed." One setback expands to fill our entire view.</p>
            <p>The Stoics practiced perspective — the deliberate act of zooming out to see the bigger picture. <strong>A bad day is just a day. It's not your whole life.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h3>The View From Above</h3>
            <p>Marcus Aurelius practiced what scholars call "the view from above" — imagining himself looking down on his problems from a great height, seeing them as small parts of a vast whole. From that vantage point, today's crisis becomes a speck in the larger pattern of a life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why We Lose Perspective</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emotional intensity:</strong> Strong feelings make everything seem more significant</li>
                <li><strong>Present bias:</strong> What's happening now feels more real than past or future</li>
                <li><strong>Negativity bias:</strong> Bad events register more strongly than good ones</li>
                <li><strong>Pattern-seeking:</strong> We look for confirming evidence of our worst interpretations</li>
                <li><strong>Exhaustion:</strong> Tired minds make dramatic assessments</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="stoic-quote">
            <div class="quote-text">"Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now, take what's left and live it properly."</div>
            <div class="quote-author">— Marcus Aurelius</div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Perspective Practices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time zoom:</strong> Will this matter in a week? A month? A year? A decade?</li>
                <li><strong>Space zoom:</strong> How does this look from far away? From outside your own head?</li>
                <li><strong>History check:</strong> Have you felt this certain about a catastrophe before? What happened?</li>
                <li><strong>Gratitude inventory:</strong> What in your life is still good, unchanged by this day?</li>
                <li><strong>Worst case examination:</strong> Even if the worst happens, could you eventually be okay?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Data of Your Life</h2>
            <p>If you've lived for 10,000 days, and 100 of them were truly bad, that's a 99% success rate. But we don't experience it that way because bad days occupy more mental real estate.</p>
            <p>The Stoics would counsel us to look at the data, not just the feeling. One bad data point doesn't change the trendline.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="practice-exercise">
            <h4>Daily Practice: The Perspective Reset</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>When a day goes badly, write down specifically what happened</li>
                <li>Ask: What percentage of my life does this represent?</li>
                <li>Ask: What's still going well that this doesn't touch?</li>
                <li>Ask: What will I think about this day a year from now?</li>
                <li>End with: "This is a bad day, not a bad life."</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>Think of something that felt catastrophic a year ago. How does it look now? What does this tell you about today's apparent catastrophes?</p>
        </div>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Bad days expand to fill our view if we let them</li>
                <li>Zooming out reveals the bigger picture</li>
                <li>A bad day is just one data point, not the whole trendline</li>
                <li>Future perspective ("Will this matter in a year?") restores proportion</li>
                <li>Distinguish between "this feels terrible" and "this is terrible"</li>
            </ul>
