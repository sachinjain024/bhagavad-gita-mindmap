            <h2>The Trap of Perfectionism</h2>
            <p>How many projects have never begun because conditions weren't "perfect"? How many ideas have died in the planning phase, waiting for the ideal moment that never comes?</p>
            <p>Perfectionism masquerades as high standards, but it's often just fear wearing a respectable mask. The Stoics valued excellence, but they understood that <strong>action precedes perfection.</strong></p>

            <h3>The Three Stages</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Do It:</strong> Start. Ship something. Get it out of your head and into the world.</li>
                <li><strong>Do It Right:</strong> Now refine. Fix the obvious problems. Apply what you learned.</li>
                <li><strong>Do It Better:</strong> Iterate toward excellence. This is an ongoing process, not a destination.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Starting Matters Most</h2>
            <p>The first version of anything is almost never good. But it serves a crucial purpose: it exists. And only things that exist can be improved.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can't edit a blank page</li>
                <li>You can't get feedback on an idea in your head</li>
                <li>You can't learn from doing something you haven't done</li>
                <li>You can't iterate on version zero</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Stoics emphasized that wisdom comes through experience, not theory. You must enter the arena to learn its lessons.</p>

            <h2>The Iteration Mindset</h2>
            <p>Excellence is not a single act but a habit. Each iteration brings you closer to mastery. The key is maintaining momentum:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Release early:</strong> Get feedback before you've invested too much</li>
                <li><strong>Learn fast:</strong> Every version teaches you something</li>
                <li><strong>Stay humble:</strong> Your first attempt isn't supposed to be your best</li>
                <li><strong>Keep moving:</strong> Stagnation is the enemy of improvement</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Daily Practice: The Minimum Viable Action</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify something you've been postponing until it can be "perfect"</li>
                <li>Define the smallest version you could complete today</li>
                <li>Do that version. Ship it. Send it. Publish it.</li>
                <li>Schedule time tomorrow to make it better</li>

            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>What would you attempt if you knew the first version didn't have to be perfect? What's the cost of waiting for conditions that may never arrive?</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Starting imperfectly beats waiting for perfection indefinitely</li>
                <li>Excellence emerges through iteration, not initial attempts</li>
                <li>Only things that exist can be improved</li>
                <li>Perfectionism is often fear in disguise</li>
                <li>Wisdom comes from doing, not from planning to do</li>
