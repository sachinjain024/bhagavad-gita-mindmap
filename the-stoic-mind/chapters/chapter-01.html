        <div class="chapter-meta">Understanding the Stoic Perspective on Balance</div>

        <div class="stoic-quote">
            <div class="quote-text">"It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested."</div>

            <h2>The Modern Imbalance</h2>
            <p>In today's hyperconnected world, it's easy to let work consume everything. We check emails at dinner, take calls during family time, and let professional stress bleed into every corner of our existence. But the Stoics understood something fundamental: <strong>work exists to serve life, not the other way around.</strong></p>
            <p>When we invert this relationship — making life a subset of work — we lose touch with what makes existence meaningful. We become defined by our job titles rather than our character, by our productivity rather than our presence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h3>The Stoic Principle</h3>
            <p>Work is a vehicle for expressing virtue and contributing to society, but it should never eclipse the broader purpose of living well. The goal is <em>eudaimonia</em> — human flourishing — not mere professional achievement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Signs Your Work Has Become the Superset</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You feel guilty when you're not being "productive"</li>
                <li>Your identity is almost entirely tied to your profession</li>
                <li>Personal relationships suffer because work "always comes first"</li>
                <li>You measure your worth by output rather than character</li>
                <li>Rest feels like wasted time rather than necessary renewal</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="stoic-quote">
            <div class="quote-text">"We are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it."</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Restoring the Balance</h2>
            <p>The Stoics didn't advocate for laziness or avoiding work. Marcus Aurelius was an emperor with immense responsibilities. Seneca was a successful statesman and businessman. They worked hard — but they understood work's proper place.</p>
            <p>Work should be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meaningful:</strong> Aligned with your values and contributing to something larger</li>
                <li><strong>Bounded:</strong> Having clear edges that protect other life domains</li>
                <li><strong>Integrated:</strong> Part of a whole life, not the whole itself</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="practice-exercise">
            <h4>Daily Practice: The Life Audit</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>At the end of each day, list what you did outside of work</li>
                <li>Ask: "Did I nurture relationships? Did I care for my body? Did I feed my mind?"</li>
                <li>If the list is empty, that's data — not judgment. Use it to adjust tomorrow.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>If your work disappeared tomorrow, what would remain? What parts of your identity exist independent of your profession? These are the foundations to strengthen.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Work serves life, not the reverse — keep this hierarchy clear</li>
                <li>Your identity should be broader than your job title</li>
                <li>Hard work is virtuous, but not at the expense of living fully</li>
                <li>Set boundaries that protect the non-work domains of your life</li>
                <li>Regular audits help you notice when work starts consuming too much</li>
            </ul>
