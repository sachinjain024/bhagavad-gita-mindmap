            <h2>The Motivation Myth</h2>
            <p>We've been sold a lie: that we need to feel like doing something before we can do it. That motivation should precede action. That inspiration is the prerequisite for productivity.</p>
            <p>The truth is the opposite. <strong>Action creates motivation.</strong> You rarely feel like starting — but once you start, the feeling follows. The Stoics knew this. They didn't wait for the right mood; they acted according to duty and principle.</p>

            <h2>Building Discipline</h2>
            <p>Discipline isn't something you're born with — it's something you build. Every small act of doing what you said you'd do, regardless of how you feel, strengthens the muscle.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start small:</strong> Don't rely on superhuman willpower. Make the first step easy.</li>
                <li><strong>Create systems:</strong> Remove the need for decisions. Automate the behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Stack habits:</strong> Attach new disciplines to existing routines.</li>
                <li><strong>Expect resistance:</strong> The feeling of not wanting to is normal. Do it anyway.</li>
                <li><strong>Track streaks:</strong> Consistency becomes its own motivation over time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Morning Test</h2>
            <p>Marcus Aurelius famously wrote about the struggle of getting out of bed. Even an emperor didn't want to face the cold morning. But he did it anyway — not because he felt like it, but because it was his duty.</p>
            <p>How you handle the first moment of resistance each day sets the pattern for everything that follows.</p>

            <h4>Daily Practice: The Non-Negotiables</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify 1-3 actions that you will do every day regardless of mood</li>
                <li>Make them specific and measurable (e.g., "10 push-ups" not "exercise")</li>
                <li>Do them at the same time each day</li>
                <li>Never negotiate with yourself about whether to do them</li>

            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>What important actions have you been postponing until you "feel motivated"? What if you accepted that the feeling might never come, and did them anyway?</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Motivation is unreliable; discipline is sustainable</li>
                <li>Action often creates motivation, not the other way around</li>
                <li>Build systems that don't depend on how you feel</li>
                <li>Every time you act despite not feeling like it, you strengthen discipline</li>
                <li>The Stoics acted from duty and principle, not mood</li>
