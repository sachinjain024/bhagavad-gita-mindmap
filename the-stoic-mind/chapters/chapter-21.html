            <div class="quote-text">"Concentrate every minute like a Roman—like a man—on doing what's in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice."</div>

            <h2>The Attention Economy</h2>
            <p>We live in an unprecedented war for human attention. Billions of dollars are invested in engineering products designed to capture, hold, and monetize your focus. Every app, notification, and feed is optimized to hijack your mind.</p>
            <p>In this environment, the ability to focus — to direct your attention where you choose and keep it there — has become extraordinarily rare and valuable. <strong>What was once ordinary is now a superpower.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h3>The Stoic on Attention</h3>
            <p>Marcus Aurelius wrote about being fully present in each moment, about giving "precise and genuine seriousness" to the task at hand. He was fighting a different battle for attention — not against algorithms, but against his own wandering mind. The solution remains the same: deliberate, practiced focus.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Cost of Fragmented Attention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shallow work:</strong> You can only skim the surface when constantly switching</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced quality:</strong> Deep work requires sustained attention that fragmentation prevents</li>
                <li><strong>Increased anxiety:</strong> Constant task-switching keeps stress hormones elevated</li>
                <li><strong>Lost creativity:</strong> Novel insights emerge from sustained contemplation</li>
                <li><strong>Attention residue:</strong> Each switch leaves mental residue that degrades performance</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="stoic-quote">
            <div class="quote-text">"The soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts."</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Building Focus Capacity</h2>
            <p>Focus is a muscle. It atrophies with disuse and strengthens with practice:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start small:</strong> Even 15 minutes of uninterrupted focus is valuable practice</li>
                <li><strong>Eliminate triggers:</strong> Put phone in another room; close unnecessary tabs</li>
                <li><strong>Schedule focus blocks:</strong> Protect time explicitly for deep work</li>
                <li><strong>Practice meditation:</strong> Trains the underlying attention faculty</li>
                <li><strong>Embrace boredom:</strong> Resist the urge to fill every quiet moment</li>
                <li><strong>Single-task ruthlessly:</strong> One thing at a time, completely</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Focused Life</h2>
            <p>Beyond productivity, focus changes the quality of experience itself. A focused life is a deeper life — more present, more engaged, more meaningful. The Stoics knew that how we direct our attention shapes who we become.</p>
            <p>In the age of distraction, choosing focus is an act of rebellion and self-determination.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="practice-exercise">
            <h4>Daily Practice: The Focus Hour</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Block one hour each day for completely uninterrupted work</li>
                <li>Before starting, close all apps, silence notifications, tell others you're unavailable</li>
                <li>Work on one important task only — no task-switching</li>
                <li>When your mind wanders, gently return it — this is the practice</li>
                <li>Gradually extend the duration as your capacity grows</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>When was the last time you spent an hour completely focused on one thing? What would become possible if you could do this daily? What are you currently allowing to steal your attention?</p>
        </div>
