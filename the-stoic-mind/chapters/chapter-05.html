            <h2>The Dual Stance of Wisdom</h2>
            <p>This chapter's principle captures a beautiful paradox: hold your convictions firmly while remaining genuinely open to being proven wrong. This isn't contradiction — it's intellectual maturity.</p>
            <p>The Stoics valued both strong reasoning and epistemic humility. They understood that we can be confident in our conclusions while acknowledging our conclusions might be incomplete or mistaken.</p>

            <h3>Two Complementary Skills</h3>
            <p><strong>Speaking confidently</strong> means presenting your ideas clearly, owning your perspective, and contributing meaningfully to discussions. It's not about volume or aggression — it's about clarity and conviction.</p>
            <p><strong>Listening carefully</strong> means genuinely considering other viewpoints, looking for what you might be missing, and being willing to update your beliefs when presented with better evidence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Dangers of Each Extreme</h2>
            <p><strong>All confidence, no listening:</strong> You become rigid, miss important information, alienate others, and stop learning. Your blind spots grow.</p>
            <p><strong>All listening, no confidence:</strong> You become wishy-washy, fail to contribute your unique perspective, let others dominate, and struggle to take action on your convictions.</p>
            <p>The Stoic aim is the middle path: strong enough to assert, humble enough to revise.</p>

            <h2>Practical Communication Strategies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>State, then inquire:</strong> "Here's what I think... What am I missing?"</li>
                <li><strong>Seek disconfirmation:</strong> Ask "What would prove me wrong?" before defending your position</li>
                <li><strong>Paraphrase first:</strong> Repeat back what you heard before responding</li>
                <li><strong>Separate ideas from identity:</strong> You can change your mind without changing who you are</li>
                <li><strong>Embrace "I was wrong":</strong> These three words build trust and demonstrate strength</li>

            <h4>Daily Practice: The Steelman Exercise</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In your next disagreement, before responding, state the strongest version of the other person's argument</li>
                <li>Ask them: "Did I capture that correctly?"</li>
                <li>Only then present your counterpoint</li>
                <li>Notice how this changes the quality of the conversation</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>When was the last time you changed your mind about something important? What allowed that to happen? If you can't remember, what might be preventing you from updating your beliefs?</p>
