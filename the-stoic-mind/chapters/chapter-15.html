            <div class="quote-text">"It is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much. The life we receive is not short but we make it so; we are not ill provided but use what we have wastefully."</div>

            <h2>The Default Mode</h2>
            <p>Without intentional design, your day gets filled by other people's priorities. Emails, meetings, requests, notifications — they arrive constantly, each claiming urgency. If you don't decide how to spend your time, others will decide for you.</p>
            <p>The Stoics valued autonomy above almost everything. They would find our modern surrender of our schedules disturbing. <strong>Your time is your life measured in hours.</strong> How could you let others allocate your life?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h3>The Stoic View of Time</h3>
            <p>Seneca wrote extensively about the preciousness of time. He noted that we guard our property jealously but give away our time — the one truly non-renewable resource — to anyone who asks. A request for five minutes of your time is a request for five minutes of your life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Signs You've Lost Control</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Your day is mostly reactive — responding to what comes at you</li>
                <li>You can't remember the last time you had uninterrupted focus time</li>
                <li>Important but non-urgent things keep getting pushed to "someday"</li>
                <li>You feel busy but not productive</li>
                <li>Other people's emergencies routinely become yours</li>
                <li>You end days exhausted but unsure what you accomplished</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="stoic-quote">
            <div class="quote-text">"People are frugal in guarding their personal property; but as soon as it comes to squandering time they are most wasteful of the one thing in which it is right to be stingy."</div>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Reclaiming Your Calendar</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Block first:</strong> Schedule your priorities before others can claim the space</li>
                <li><strong>Protect mornings:</strong> Many find early hours most productive — guard them</li>
                <li><strong>Batch similar tasks:</strong> Context-switching is expensive; group like activities</li>
                <li><strong>Learn to say no:</strong> Every yes to others is a no to something of yours</li>
                <li><strong>Build buffers:</strong> Leave white space; not every hour needs to be filled</li>
                <li><strong>Review weekly:</strong> Did you spend time on what matters? Adjust accordingly</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Power of No</h2>
            <p>Saying no is not selfish — it's necessary. You cannot serve everyone and everything. Every commitment has an opportunity cost. The Stoics would ask: What are you saying no to when you say yes to this?</p>
            <p>Practice responses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"I can't commit to that right now."</li>
                <li>"That doesn't fit my priorities this quarter."</li>
                <li>"I need to check my capacity before agreeing."</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="practice-exercise">
            <h4>Daily Practice: The Morning Definition</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Before opening email or messages, define your day's top 3 priorities</li>
                <li>Block time for these before anything else claims it</li>
                <li>When requests come, ask: "Does this serve my defined priorities?"</li>
                <li>End each day by reviewing: Did I protect time for what mattered?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>Look at your calendar for the past week. What percentage of your time served your stated priorities versus others' agendas? What would change if you protected your time more fiercely?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you don't define your day, others will define it for you</li>
                <li>Time is your life in hours — guard it as your most precious resource</li>
                <li>Schedule priorities first, before reactive tasks claim the space</li>
                <li>Every yes has an opportunity cost — count that cost</li>
                <li>Saying no is not selfish; it's necessary for intentional living</li>
            </ul>
