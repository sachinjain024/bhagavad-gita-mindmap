            <h2>The Chain of Development</h2>
            <p>Success doesn't arrive randomly or all at once. It's the culmination of a chain reaction that begins with something deceptively simple: doing things, failing, learning, and doing them again.</p>
            <p>This chapter maps that journey: Experience → Wisdom → Confidence → Success. Each link depends on the previous one. You can't skip steps.</p>

            <h3>The Four Links</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Experience:</strong> Raw exposure to reality — doing, trying, failing, observing</li>
                <li><strong>Wisdom:</strong> The patterns and principles extracted from experience through reflection</li>
                <li><strong>Confidence:</strong> The trust in yourself that comes from knowing you've navigated similar terrain</li>
                <li><strong>Success:</strong> The natural outcome of confident action guided by wisdom</li>
            </ol>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Experience Must Come First</h2>
            <p>The Stoics were deeply practical philosophers. They didn't believe in armchair wisdom — knowledge divorced from action. Seneca wrote about the danger of "learning only from books" without testing ideas in the crucible of real life.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Experience provides the raw data that wisdom organizes</li>
                <li>Failure teaches what success cannot</li>
                <li>Theory without practice is hollow and fragile</li>
                <li>You can't shortcut to wisdom — you must earn it</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Converting Experience to Wisdom</h2>
            <p>Not all experience becomes wisdom. Many people have decades of experience but haven't extracted much learning. The key is reflection:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>After success:</strong> What worked? Why? How can I replicate this?</li>
                <li><strong>After failure:</strong> What happened? What did I miss? What will I do differently?</li>
                <li><strong>During stagnation:</strong> What am I avoiding? What new experiences do I need?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Marcus Aurelius's Meditations are essentially a record of this reflection process — him processing his experiences into principles.</p>

        <div class="practice-exercise">
            <h4>Daily Practice: The Experience Journal</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Each evening, write down one experience from the day (positive or negative)</li>
                <li>Ask: "What did this teach me?"</li>
                <li>Ask: "How will this inform my future actions?"</li>
                <li>Review weekly to spot emerging patterns and principles</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>Think of a time when you gained genuine confidence in an area. Trace back the chain: What experiences led to what wisdom that led to that confidence? How might you replicate this process intentionally?</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Success is the end of a chain: Experience → Wisdom → Confidence → Success</li>
                <li>You cannot skip steps — each builds on the previous</li>
                <li>Experience without reflection doesn't become wisdom</li>
                <li>Seek experiences that stretch you, then process what they teach</li>
                <li>This cycle is renewable and compounding over a lifetime</li>
