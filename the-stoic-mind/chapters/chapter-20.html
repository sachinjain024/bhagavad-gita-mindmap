            <h2>The External Expectation Trap</h2>
            <p>From childhood, we're conditioned to meet others' expectations: parents, teachers, bosses, society. We internalize these standards so deeply that we often can't distinguish them from our own authentic desires.</p>
            <p>The Stoics would ask: Whose life are you living? If you're constantly measuring yourself against others' standards, you might achieve their version of success while missing your own.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h3>The Stoic Inner Citadel</h3>
            <p>The Stoics spoke of an "inner citadel" — a fortress of personal values and judgments that external forces cannot penetrate. Your standards, your definition of success, your sense of integrity — these should come from within this citadel, not be imported from outside.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Identifying External Standards</h2>
            <p>Ask yourself about your current goals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Would I want this if no one ever knew I achieved it?</li>
                <li>Whose voice do I hear when I imagine "success"?</li>
                <li>Am I pursuing this because I want it or because I should want it?</li>
                <li>If everyone I know disappeared, would this still matter to me?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>External expectations often masquerade as personal desires.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stoic-quote">
            <div class="quote-text">"The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts."</div>
            <div class="quote-author">— Marcus Aurelius</div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Defining Your Own Standards</h2>
            <p>True success requires knowing what you actually value. Consider these domains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Character:</strong> What kind of person do I want to be?</li>
                <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> What quality of connection matters to me?</li>
                <li><strong>Work:</strong> What kind of contribution feels meaningful?</li>
                <li><strong>Daily life:</strong> What does a good day look like for me?</li>
                <li><strong>Legacy:</strong> What do I want to have created or changed?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your answers may differ wildly from society's defaults — and that's exactly the point.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Living with Integrity</h2>
            <p>Integrity means alignment between your values and your actions. When you define success by your own standards, integrity becomes possible. When you chase external expectations, you're always performing rather than living.</p>
            <p>The Stoics valued integrity above external success. A person who achieved little by society's measures but lived according to their own principles was more successful than an emperor who compromised his values for power.</p>

            <h4>Daily Practice: The Authentic Goal Test</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>List your top 5 current goals</li>
                <li>For each, ask: "Where did this goal come from?"</li>
                <li>Mark which are authentically yours vs. inherited from others</li>
                <li>For inherited goals, ask: Do I actually want this? Or just think I should?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>If you achieved everything society considers successful but didn't meet your own deepest standards, would you feel successful? What would have to be true for you to feel genuinely fulfilled?</p>
