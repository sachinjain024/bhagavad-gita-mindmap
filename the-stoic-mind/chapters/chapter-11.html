        <div class="chapter-meta">Transforming Setbacks into Stepping Stones</div>

        <div class="stoic-quote">
            <div class="quote-text">"The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way."</div>
            <div class="quote-author">— Marcus Aurelius</div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Reframing Failure</h2>
            <p>We tend to view mistakes as evidence of inadequacy — proof that we're not good enough. But the Stoics saw failures differently: as teachers. Every stumble contains information. Every setback illuminates something you couldn't have learned any other way.</p>
            <p>The mistake itself is in the past — unchangeable, fixed in history. But the lesson lives on and can be applied infinitely. <strong>Which would you rather dwell on?</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h3>The Stoic View of Obstacles</h3>
            <p>Marcus Aurelius's famous principle — "the obstacle is the way" — suggests that difficulties aren't interruptions to our path but actually constitute the path. The mistake isn't a detour from growth; it's a direct route to it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why We Get Stuck on Mistakes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ego protection:</strong> We don't want to be wrong, so we avoid examining why we were</li>
                <li><strong>Shame spiral:</strong> Self-blame consumes the energy needed for analysis</li>
                <li><strong>Fixed mindset:</strong> We see the mistake as defining us rather than informing us</li>
                <li><strong>Rumination:</strong> Replaying the error without extracting the lesson</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="stoic-quote">
            <div class="quote-text">"It is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness."</div>
            <div class="quote-author">— Seneca</div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Extracting the Lesson</h2>
            <p>After any mistake or failure, work through these questions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>What happened?</strong> (Facts only, no judgment)</li>
                <li><strong>What did I assume that turned out to be wrong?</strong></li>
                <li><strong>What information did I miss or ignore?</strong></li>
                <li><strong>What would I do differently if I could replay this?</strong></li>
                <li><strong>What's the principle I can apply going forward?</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>The goal is to transform a specific mistake into a general lesson that applies beyond this single instance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Post-Mortem Without Blame</h2>
            <p>The Stoics practiced a form of self-examination that was rigorous but not harsh. Seneca would review his day each evening, asking what he had done wrong, but the tone was curious rather than condemning.</p>
            <p>Approach your mistakes like a scientist studying data, not a judge passing sentence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="practice-exercise">
            <h4>Daily Practice: The Evening Review</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>At day's end, identify one thing that didn't go as planned</li>
                <li>Write down what happened without self-criticism</li>
                <li>Extract one concrete lesson or principle</li>
                <li>Identify one specific action you'll take tomorrow based on this learning</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>Think of a significant past failure. What lesson did it teach you? How has that lesson served you since? Would you have learned this any other way?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mistakes are teachers, not verdicts on your worth</li>
                <li>The obstacle is the way — difficulties are the path to growth</li>
                <li>Separate what happened from what it means about you</li>
                <li>Extract principles that apply beyond the specific situation</li>
                <li>Review errors with curiosity, not condemnation</li>
            </ul>
